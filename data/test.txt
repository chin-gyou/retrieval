How come it is slow as a snail today ? __eou__ You mean the network connection ? __eou__ Yes , I wanted to look for some information on the company page just now . It took me almost one minute to open it . Then there is no response for any click . __eou__ I have the same question . I can ’ t send out mails . We ’ d better call the IT department and ask them to check it immediately . __eou__ Ok . __eou__
A : Look at this survey conducted by a website . A quarter of the employees will spend an average of 10 minutes everyday online doing personal things . Hi , Francis , what about you ? __eou__ Well , I just spend 15 minutes as so checking my stock bonds and booking an air ticket for my mother . Anyway , I have done all my work and it is about the time to leave . __eou__ Though our company doesn ’ t have a return policy , limiting the personal use of internet , I don ’ t think the boss will like us to do that . __eou__ Certainly , work always comes first . __eou__ But it is lucky for us . The company computers don ’ t have software keeping tracks of websites we visit . I have shopped too often online these days . __eou__ Well , keep a low profile . __eou__
How are your Chinese and English ? __eou__ I can confidently say that my Chinese and English are pretty good . I won prizes in many speech contests in both Chinese and English . __eou__ How would you consider your salary if you succeed in becoming a translator in our company ? __eou__ I believe every company has its own salary criterion . And you will give me a satisfying salary according to my abilities and performances . __eou__
Why do you change your job and apply for a translator ? __eou__ This job is more challenging and I have longed to be a translator . That ’ s why I came here for an interview . __eou__ What do you think are the capacities for a success as a translator ? __eou__ I think one needs common knowledge , specific knowledge , and professional codes to be a successful translator . __eou__
Hi , Alan . I feel very nervous because I am going to have a job interview next Monday . Could you please give me some suggestions ? __eou__ Sure . Firstly , it is very important for you to be punctual . Interviewers usually don ’ t think much of a candidate who comes 5 or 10 minutes late only to explain that he could not find the place or he was stuck in traffic . __eou__ Yeah , that is very important . __eou__ Secondly , you need to create a good image in a limited time . __eou__ I will try my best to make a good impression , but it is always easier said that done . __eou__ I think you should make some preparations . For example , you should take care to appear well-groomed and modestly dressed . What ’ s more , try to avoid a too causal style . __eou__ Can I wear T-shirt and jeans for the job interview ? __eou__ You ’ d better not . Informal clothes like sports shirts , tom jeans or dirty sneakers convey the impression that you are not serious about the job , or that you may be casual about your work as you are about your clothes . __eou__ I've got it . I think I will wear a white shirt with a tie . Thank you for your suggestions . __eou__
Brian , a company called me for an interview . __eou__ That's great ! You need to prepare for it . __eou__ How ? __eou__ Get your hair done at a good hair saloon . Tell them you are going for a job interview . __eou__ Okay . __eou__ Buy an expensive suit . __eou__ How expensive ? __eou__ The more expensive , the better . __eou__ I can ’ t afford too expensive , maybe $ 50 to $ 70 ? __eou__ That'll do it . The best way is to find the dressing color code of the company . __eou__ How ? __eou__ If you know somebody at the company , ask them . If not , dark color will be fine . __eou__ Is a white blouse okay ? __eou__ Yeah , fine . And dressing shoes . __eou__ Black ? __eou__ Black is good . __eou__ White pantyhose ? __eou__ No . Dark or skin colored . __eou__ Jewelry ? __eou__ Necklace , ring , and earrings are all fine . But don ’ t wear too many pieces of jewelry . __eou__ How about make up ? __eou__ Not much make up . __eou__ Perfume ? __eou__ Yes , some . But be aware that different people may like different scents . __eou__
Do you have any sales experience ? __eou__ Yes , I worked in a fashion shop as a part time salesgirl . __eou__ What kind of work are you doing now ? __eou__ I'm working as an export sales staff member for a trade company . __eou__ Where are you working ? __eou__ I work at Yangshi Trade Company Ltd . I have been working there since 1997 . __eou__
May I help you ? __eou__ Yes , I ’ Ve come in apply for the position as head of claim department . __eou__ I ’ m Smith , the manager of Human Resources Department . May I ask your name ? __eou__ My name is Zhang Due . __eou__ Would you tell me what education background you have ? __eou__ I graduated from Beijing College of Foreign Trade . My major was International Trade . __eou__ Do you have any experience in this field ? __eou__ Yes , I have been working in Lush Insurance Company for four years . __eou__ OK . Do you think you are proficient in both written and spoken English ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ OK . I will accept you for a three months-period of probation . Is this satisfactory ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__
Did you see the woman that just left my office ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ She's another applicant , and a leading contender , but I didn ’ t want to hire her . She ’ s qualified , but she doesn ’ t quite fit the profile . We ’ re looking for an accountant , and part of the job requires interacting with clients . Well , our clients want conservative people to handle their money . And green hair with ripped jeans doesn ’ t exactly fill them with trust . __eou__ But it's the style now . __eou__ I realize that , but our business is serving clients and giving them what they want . __eou__ Of course . __eou__ Well , they don ’ t want to deal with people who look like that . They want people who look more like yourself . __eou__ Why is that ? __eou__ Well , they ’ re older , and they don ’ t understand today's fashions . When they see someone dressed like that , warning bells go off . They don ’ t like that style at all , and they don ’ t like dealing with people who dress like that at work . __eou__ Oh , I see . __eou__ We used to have a woman here who dressed like that and she was good , very good . But , the clients reacted very negatively when they saw her . Some asked that their account be given to someone who dressed more conservatively . __eou__ What happened to her ? __eou__ Well , she was a very good employee and we wanted to keep her , so her supervisor called her in for a chat and laid it on the line for her . She got the idea and now she saves the trendy styles for evenings and weekends . __eou__ I see . __eou__
How about your grades of study ? __eou__ I have been doing quite well . As reach 90 % and Bs reach 100 % . And I ’ Ve received Scholarship two times . __eou__ Besides your major , do you know some in other fields ? __eou__ Yes . To develop my knowledge , I studied Economics , Business Administration and Accountingthrough self-study . Nowadays , I have passed three courses on CPA . __eou__ Have you ever been a student cadre ? __eou__ Yes . I used to be the monitor of my class . __eou__ Did it affect you much ? __eou__ It ’ s a very important experience for me . First , it improved my organizing ability , and let me understand how to resolve a problem in the overall perspective instead of my own perspective . Second , it let me know how to cooperate in harmony with people who I like or dislike . __eou__ In your spare time , do you have any part time jobs ? __eou__ Yes , I used to work as an assistant lawyer for Tienda Law Office . __eou__
Hi , George . I'm going to have a job interview next week . Could you give me some advice ? __eou__ Sure . First of all , it ’ s very important for you not to be late . Job interviewers usually don ’ t think very highly of a candidate who arrives ten minutes after the appointed time , only to explain that he could not find the place or that there was heavy traffic . __eou__ Yeah , that's very important . __eou__ So you ’ d better explore the place the day before and at the same time , look around to see what the employees are wearing . So the next day you will arrive early for the appointment . __eou__ I ’ ll try my best to make a good impression on the interviewer . __eou__ That ’ s right . You need to create a good image in a limited time , usually about 30 to 45 minutes . __eou__ It ’ s always easier to say something than to do it . __eou__ It ’ s not too difficult to make a good impression . For example , you should take care to appear well-groomed and modestly dressed . Avoid the extremes of a too elaborate or too casual style . This will put you on the same level as other applicants and make the interviewer consider more important qualifications . __eou__ But I love wearing T-shirts and jeans . __eou__ I advise you not to wear a too casual style when going to an interview . Informal clothes as well as torn jeans and dirty shoes convey the impression that you are not serious about the job , or that you may be casual about your work as you are about your clothes . __eou__ It ’ s a pity that I cannot afford more expensive clothes . __eou__ You misunderstood me . Clothes which are too colorful or too expensive suggest that you do not understand what behavior is appropriate for the job , or that you are snobbish or frivolous . __eou__ I know what you mean . I ought to wear right clothes at the right time . __eou__ You got it . Only in this way can you gain the respect of the interviewer and his confidence in your judgement . __eou__ It seems that ' clothes make the man ' . __eou__ It may not be true , but the first and lasting impression of you is determined by your clothes and behavior . __eou__
What are you typing there ? __eou__ I'm working on my resume . __eou__ Really ? Did you find any information about a new job ? __eou__ Yeah , I just got some good information off the internet . __eou__ Great ! Do you think you have a chance at getting the job ? __eou__ I didn ’ t just find out about one job . There were several ones that looked good . __eou__ Maybe I should try looking on the web for work . __eou__ Sure you have to be patient . But I think it ’ s much less trouble to sit in front of a computer than to go door to door or to make a lot of phone calls . __eou__ But there must be so many people who also see the advertisement for that job on the net . You might have no chance . __eou__ How do you know if you don ’ t have a try ? __eou__
What kind of jobs have you had ? __eou__ I worked as a personnel manager in a state-owned company , and then I transferred to a joint venture as a sales manager . So I am familiar with the exile market in China . __eou__ How did your previous employers treat you ? __eou__ They treated me very well . We cooperated harmoniously and respected each other . __eou__ What have you learned from the jobs you have had ? __eou__ I have learned some skills about how to deal with clients and how to behave myself as a personnel manager . __eou__ When you worked in your previous company , which did you prefer , working with other people or by yourself ? __eou__ I prefered working with other colleagues when I worked in my previous company . I think teamwork and cooperation are very important . No matter how competent he or she is in a company , he can't do without them . __eou__
Hello , Pratt . How was your interview yesterday ? __eou__ Hello , Finn . I did a wonderful job and I was employed . How about you ? __eou__ I am sorry to tell you that I have lost the opportunity . __eou__ Why ? You are so excellent . I think you are the most suitable person for the job . __eou__ Yes , I know I am excellent , but I pay no attention to the etiquette you ’ Ve told me . __eou__ What ? Then what did you do ? __eou__ When I entered the room , I forgot to close the door . Later , I couldn ’ t help smoking , you know I am a heavy-smoker . What ’ s more , I forgot to polish my shoes . There is some dirt on it . __eou__ You are so careless . You know they are the basic rules you should follow before you attend an interview . Do remember not to smoke any more , otherwise , you can ’ t find a job . __eou__ Yes , I know . And next time I must make good preparations . __eou__ Good luck next time . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__
Are you here for the position advertised in China Daily ? __eou__ Yes , I am . I'm very interested in that advertisement about hiring a computer program designer , and hope to know a little more about it . __eou__ What kind of information would you like ? __eou__ Well , first I would like to know if this position is still available . __eou__ Yes , it's still open . __eou__ Terrific ! Then how should I apply for ? __eou__ Oh , we need your resume , health report , three photographs and several letters of recommendation . Would you please send them to us by next Wednesday ? __eou__ Thank you very much . Bye-bye . __eou__
Miss Wang , how do you do ? I ’ m Allan James , the director of human recourse department of this company . __eou__ How do you do , Mr . James ? Thank you for asking me to come in . __eou__ Not at all . Please sit down , then we can begin . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ As you know , Miss Wang , we are looking for an executive secretary with business background and good English skills . We looked into your resume and thought you might be a good candidate . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ Today ’ s interview is for us to get to know a little about you .

Smith . __eou__ Certainly , Mr . Smith . __eou__
Are you married ? __eou__ Yes , I've just married . __eou__ How long have you been married ? __eou__ I have been married for three years . __eou__ How many people are there in your family ? __eou__ There are four people in my family . __eou__ Who are the members of your family ? __eou__ My husband , my mother-in-law , my daughter and I . __eou__
Where do you live ? __eou__ I live in Beijing . __eou__ What's your permanent address ? __eou__ My permanent address is Apt . 401 , 238 Zhongshan Road , Beijing . __eou__ Where is your birthplace ? __eou__ My birthplace is Suzhou . __eou__ Where is your domicile ? __eou__ My domicile is Beijing . __eou__ Give me your telephone number , please . __eou__ ( My telephone number is ) 139xxxxx345 . __eou__
I think if I ’ m going to find a job , I ’ ll look over the job board . __eou__ Well , there ’ s no doubt that lots of people have found employment in the help wanted section . __eou__ Right , so I picked up a copy of the Sunday Globe this morning . __eou__ Did you get a copy of the Herald too ? __eou__ No , why should I ? The Globe ’ s help wanted section is the best . __eou__ That ’ s true , but still the Herald lists some jobs the Globe doesn ’ t have . __eou__ Not enough to worry about . Why do I waste the money buying two papers ? __eou__ It's only a couple of dollars more . For that much money you can afford to risk it . __eou__ I guess you ’ re right . I'll get a Herald as soon as I finish looking over the Globe . __eou__ Good idea . __eou__
Hello . May I help you ? __eou__ Yes , please . I've been here for nearly two months , but I still haven ’ t found a job . Do you think you can find one for me ? __eou__ Don ’ t worry , we ’ ll try to help you . Will you please fill out this form ? __eou__ What ’ s this form for ? __eou__ This is for registration . After you have given us your personal details , we'll match these against new jobs as they come in . And we ’ ll contact you when there is a job that suits you . __eou__ That's great . But how long do I have to wait ? __eou__ Maybe several weeks , maybe several months . It's hard to tell . __eou__ Oh , dear . How can I wait for such a long time ? __eou__ Actually , many jobs are filled by people who select vacancies from the display boards there . __eou__ Then , what do you think I should do ? __eou__ My advice is to keep looking for jobs yourself . Check the job boards at the job center regularly and check the newspapers daily . If you have friends or relatives here , ask them for help , too . __eou__ I see . Thank you very much for your advice . Bye . __eou__ Keep in touch . __eou__
I called about that ad we saw in the paper . __eou__ For the bank manager ? __eou__ That ’ s the one . __eou__ What happened ? __eou__ You were right , it was from a headhunter . He wouldn't tell me anything without a signed contract . __eou__ Well , no surprise there . __eou__ No ! Not at all . But I did find out they have more than one position with different clients , so at least one would probably work out . __eou__ Great , so are you going to sign a contract with them ? __eou__ I ’ m going there tomorrow . __eou__ Great ! Good luck . __eou__ And I think I'll look in on a few other Employment Agencies while I ’ m downtown , to see what they have . __eou__ Good idea . The more people you ask , the better your chances are . __eou__
The boss announces the pay raise today , right ? How much do you think we'll get ? __eou__ No idea . Your guess is as good as mine . __eou__ It better be more than last year . __eou__ Well , anything is better than nothing . Wait and see . __eou__

And what about now ? __eou__ For this is your first day in our company , you can begin with our special products . Before you do your job , it's necessary for you to be familiar with our own products . Sort these papers and file them correctly . __eou__ OK , I'll get to work on it at once . __eou__

You are not expected to sit down before being invited , and you shouldn ’ t throw yourself into the chair like you ’ re loading heavy baggage . __eou__ And we should have good sitting posture . __eou__ That ’ s right . The ideal posture for women is to put their legs together and lean to one side . This is especially important in summer . __eou__ Where should I put my overcoat and briefcase after entering the office ? __eou__ Put it beside you . Don ’ t pile your purses , briefcase and other belongings on the employer ’ s desk . You've got long hair . Don ’ t touch it while talking to the interviewer . It gives people the feeling that you cannot concentrate on your work . __eou__ I think that ’ s the reason why Princess Diana ’ s hair style became so popular . __eou__ Also , if you are asked to sit beside the employer's desk , neither lean on it nor look at the documents there . __eou__ I ought to respect other people ’ s privacy , as most Westerners do . __eou__ As the saying goes , when in Rome , do as the Romans do . __eou__
I am an eloquent speaker in the classroom . But when I face a stranger outside , I get tongue-tied and nothing comes out . __eou__ You should pay close attention to your manner of speaking . Speech is a reflection of personality , you know . You should reflect confidence by speaking in a low voice , loud enough to be heard without being aggressive or overpowering . __eou__ I will go out of my way to catch the attention of the interviewer . __eou__ Your speech should not call attention to itself , but should reveal your individuality and ability . __eou__ I ’ m very shy . I think I might shake in my boots at the moment I meet the interviewer . __eou__ You ’ d better overcome your nervousness . it is considered an indication that you lack self-confidence . __eou__ Another problem is that I dare not look into their eyes whenever I meet strangers , especially foreigners . __eou__ In China , it is impolite to look into the senior speakers eyes while speaking . But in Western countries it is the opposite . Eye contact gives a strong feeling of sincerity . Looking downwards or sideways shows that you are either insincere or absent-minded . __eou__ Is there anything else that I should pay attention to in an interview ? __eou__ Yes . Don ’ t eat onions or garlic before you come . If you do you ’ ll have bad breath . __eou__ I ’ ll remember to bring gum with me . __eou__ You should never chew gum or smoke during an interview , even if you are allowed to do so . __eou__ I remember now . Your advice is very helpful . __eou__
Can you drive ? __eou__ Yes , I have a driving license . __eou__ Are you willing to drive yourself if the job requires ? __eou__ Sure . __eou__ One more thing , if you are wanted in this position , you must prepare to travel aboard frequently . __eou__ That's fine with me . __eou__ Would you mind relocating ? __eou__ As long as it isn't too far from this city , I don't mind . __eou__ It ’ s quite far away , though it's located in another part of the city . Are you planning to find a boarding house nearby ? __eou__ I think I can commute that far without any trouble . __eou__ Good . Do you have any particular conditions that you want us to take into consideration ? __eou__ No , nothing in particular . Thank you . __eou__ Then you'll need to know it's a hard job . You'll often have to work overtime or even on weekends . __eou__ Yes , but I don't mind working hard . __eou__
I have a feeling you will get this job . __eou__ Thanks . But I'm not so sure . Interviews stress me out . __eou__ Just remember to be professional and polite . Oh , and don ’ t forget to smile . __eou__ I ’ ll do my best , but sometimes I have trouble being myself in stressful situations . __eou__ Have you updated your resume recently ? __eou__ Yes ... ah ! I forgot to include my e-mail address . __eou__ You ’ d better double-and-triple check it . You don ’ t want to have any embarrassing typos on your resume . Otherwise , you might shoot yourself in the foot . __eou__ I ’ ll be sure and do that . I also need to pick out the right suit , shirt , and tie for this interview . __eou__ Definitely . Oh , do you have a reference letter ? __eou__ Sort of . I prepared a list of all the people who can vouch for my experience and good work ethic . __eou__ I ’ m included on your list of references , right ? My praise of you could really make a difference . __eou__ Sorry , you ’ re not on it . I don ’ t think using my brother as a reference would be very convincing ! __eou__
Hello , Nancy , nice to see you . __eou__ Nice to see you , too . I heard you are a staff of Nokia company . __eou__ Yes , I ’ m satisfied with this job . __eou__ Congratulations . What did you do during the interview ? __eou__ Pay more attention to the external expressions , because they are important for the first impression . Good manner and style of conversation can let other feel your good self-cultivation . Good gestures and mien can let other feel very comfortable . __eou__ How can I have the good external expressions ? __eou__ Don ’ t worry about that . You just pay more attention to the details of people ’ s action in life , and you will know how to transfer information by their body language . __eou__
What is your long term career plan you set for yourself ? __eou__ First of all , I hope to spend a few years working in some famous companies to command a skill , to set a solid foundation and to build my interpersonal network . When I feel I have accumulated enough experience , I hope to own an undertaking . Of course this is up to the situation then and the opportunities the companies offer me . In the long run , I hope to be an entrepreneur . __eou__

There are five of us — grandmother , father , mother , sister and I . __eou__ Are you married ? __eou__ No . I'm still single . __eou__

How about the working hours ? __eou__ From 9 to 12 a . m . , and 2 to 6 p . m . __eou__ Can I ask for a leave ? __eou__ Of course , if necessary . __eou__ Are there any other jobs waiting for me in the future ? __eou__ Seldom . __eou__ That's OK .

Wharfs your ability in these two fields ? __eou__ I passed college English Test Band - 4 , with good skill in listening , speaking , reading and writing . I haven't got any certificate of computer skills , because I don ’ t think certificates are necessary if what's needed is merely operating a computer .

I think the most important thing , I learnt though , was the importance of keeping good records . __eou__

China is certainly growing more quickly than I had imagined . __eou__ Yes . Things certainly have changed since I was a boy .

Hello , Mr . Wang . I am glad to meet you here at the fair . __eou__ Like wise . Take a seat , please . How about a cup of tea ? __eou__ Sure . Thank you . It seems your business is prosperous . There are many customers here . __eou__ Yes , it's not too bad . Our sales are going up year after year . And we still have a large potential production capacity . __eou__ Well , what do you think of choosing a commission representative or agent abroad to promote your sales ? __eou__ That's a good idea . So far , we have several agents abroad . __eou__ We are willing to be your agent in Thailand for hand-held tools . What do you think ? __eou__ That sounds good . __eou__ Then , what's your usual commission rate for your agents ? __eou__ Usually , we give a commission of 4 % to our agents . __eou__ 4 % is too low , I think . You see , we have a lot of work to do in sales promotion , such as advertising on radio or TV , printing booklets , leaflets , catalogues and so on . It all costs money , 4 % is not enough . __eou__ Don't worry . We'll allow you a higher commission rate if your sales score a substantial increase . __eou__ You mean to saya __eou__ It sounds OK . Then how do you pay the commission ? __eou__ We may deduct the commission from the invoice value directly or remit it to you after payment . __eou__ All right . If it's okay , we would like to sign an agency agreement with you immediately . __eou__ Think it over . We hope to keep a good business relationship with you . __eou__ Thank you for your help . __eou__
That was a very interesting presentation , Ms . Wang . My colleagues and I are very impressed with your proposal . __eou__ Oh , no , surely .

Thank you . __eou__ Excellent . Have you had French food before ? __eou__ Oh , yes . Marvelous ! __eou__
So , now we have covered all the important points . __eou__ Yes , I think so . __eou__ Before we draft the contract , let's examine the details . __eou__ Ok , under this contract , we ’ ll supply you with 600 dozen T-shirts , S , M and L equally assorted , at USD 100 per dozen , CFR London . Shipment in July . Payment by irrevocable sight LC . __eou__ Perfect . But what I ’ m concerned about most is the time of delivery 。 __eou__ You may rest assured that shipment will be effected within the time limits stipulated in the contract . But there is also one point I ’ d like to stress . __eou__ Yes ? __eou__ Your LC must be opened at least onemonth before the time shipment , otherwise we won't be able to catch the ship . __eou__ No problem . I ’ ll have the covering LC opened as soon as I wetback .

I don't like it very much . __eou__ I work in a cubicle too , but I don't mind it . __eou__

I think these patterns are quite good . Can you give me a price indication of these ? __eou__ Of course , it's my pleasure . We'll quote you the lowest price prevailing . __eou__ Thank you very much . If your price is suitable , then we can make further discussion of contract . __eou__ Here is our price list , our terms are cash within three months of date of delivery , if you can pay it within one month . we'll give you a discount of 10 % . __eou__ Very good .

I've just visited your showroom . You surely get a lot of fancy bedsheets . I like them very much . __eou__ I'm glad you like them . They are all made of silk .

Is it pure silk ? __eou__ Yes . It is the latest product and is highly recommended because of its fine design and quality . You certainly have an eye for good things . __eou__ Thank you for saying that . But what's the unit price ? __eou__ Here is the catalogue and the price list . You can take a look . __eou__ The price seems acceptable . Can you supply the bedsheets now if we order some ? __eou__ No problem . __eou__ That's fine . Then let's sign a contract . __eou__
We can offer you a 5 % discount . __eou__ Your price is rather out of line , much higher than we expected . We can't buy with your offer . __eou__ Well , what do you suggest then ? How about 8 % ? __eou__ When we say your prices are much too high , we don't mean the are higher only by 2 or 3 percent . If we are to place an order with you . I think a discount of about 15 % would be sufficient . __eou__ What ? You want to drive me bankrupt ! You can't expect us to make such a large reduction . __eou__ There's no point in making a counter offer because the gap is too great . __eou__ How about lo % ? This price is already a little tight , our profit margin is not that large . __eou__ Ok . I can settle for that . __eou__
We're considering of ordering 200 computers , but I'm wondering about the price you'll possibly offer . __eou__ Our price will be not less than $ 5000 . __eou__ Your price is higher than I expected . Could you give us a little discount ? __eou__ This is already our best price . __eou__ But the price is always negotiable and you should consider our quantity of order . __eou__ Well , what would you suggest ? __eou__ Could you make it $ 4500 ? __eou__ I'm afraid that there is no room to negotiate the price . This is the best price we can quote . __eou__ Can we meet each other half way ? __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ Let's close the deal at $ 4800 , OK ? __eou__ You drive a hard bargain ! OK , that's a deal . __eou__
We are interested in your pure silk , but I'm wondering about the price . How much will you possibly offer us ? __eou__ It's $ 120 per yard including a 5 % discount . __eou__ That's much higher than I expected . Can you come down a bit ? __eou__ But if you placed a larger order , we would increase the discount to 10 % . __eou__ Supposing we agreed to your price , what payment terms could you offer us ? __eou__ Maybe we would consider a longer credit period . __eou__ That would be nice . Let's call it a deal . __eou__
We're thinking of ordering fifty refrigerators . But , there's one problem . __eou__ What's that ? I thought our negotiation went very well . __eou__ The only problem is the price . It's not possible for us to make any sales at this price . __eou__ $ 1500 is almost the lowest price we can offer . __eou__ I'm afraid I can't agree with you there . Your price is much higher than other companies . __eou__ You get what you pay for , considering the high quality , our price is very reasonable . __eou__ I don't deny that the refrigerator is of top quality . If you could go a little lower , we'll place the order right away . __eou__ Sorry , I can't give you an immediate answer for this problem , let me talk to our general manager first . __eou__ All right , we'll wait for your answer . __eou__
Strange looking handle on that coffee mug , isn't it ? __eou__ We submitted two designs to our buyers , this one and one with the mug indented to form a grip . They chose this one . __eou__ What's the advantage ? Price , I suppose . __eou__ No , this type cleans better , no crevices between the body and handle joint . __eou__ What deliveries are you quoting nowadays on orders such as ours ? __eou__ We can make shipment within one month from receipt of order . __eou__ You don't do much in porcelain tiles and ornaments , do you ? __eou__ We do a fair amount in tiles and in insulators for electrical appliances . But kitchenware and tableware are our mainlines . __eou__ I see . Well , keep up the good work . See you later . __eou__
I'm ready to place an order with you , but only one condition that the goods are confined to Australia . Can you do that ? __eou__ Well , I haven't made such arrangements with the factory yet . So I'd like to make sure if it is acceptable to the factory before making a commitment to you . __eou__ All right , but I'm busy . How long will it be before you can finish the talk ? __eou__ I won't be too long , I suppose . Just let me ring them , will you ? __eou__ Go ahead . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__
If I remember correctly , time of delivery is another point in which we differ . __eou__ That's right . Let's go into details of it . __eou__ Ok . I hope you can have these goods delivered before the end of September . We'd like them to be ready in time for our Christmas sales . __eou__ Christmas doesn't come until the end of the year , does it ? __eou__ No . But in the United States , the Christmas season begins about a month before December 25 . __eou__ Well , I'm afraid a little bit difficult for us to advanced the time of shipment . Our manufacturers are fully committed at the moment . __eou__ I hope you can try to get them to step up production . __eou__ They are already working three shifts a day to step up production as new orders keep pouring in . __eou__ If that's the case , there's nothing to be done about it . __eou__ I'm sorry . __eou__ What's your last word as to the delivery date then ? __eou__ By the middle of October . This is the best we can do . __eou__ All right . I'll take your words at that . __eou__ Good . Let's call it a deal . And we'll do our best to advance the shipment , but your letter of credit should be opened early September . __eou__ I promise . __eou__
Hello ! Is Mr . Green there ? __eou__ Speaking . May I ask whom I am talking to ? __eou__ This is Li with Silk Company . We met last Sunday during the exhibition . __eou__ Oh , yes . I remember your company . __eou__ Thank you for visiting our products . I remember that you are interested in our silk products and so , could I have a meeting with you this week to show you moreinformation about our products ? __eou__ I'd like to , but I'm afraid that my schedule is full this week . __eou__ What about next week ? Is it convenient for you ? __eou__ Am . How about 10 a . m . on next Friday ? __eou__ Any time you say is OK . __eou__ All right , expecting you . __eou__
Hi ! May I help you ? __eou__ Thank you ! I am interested in your product . But I am not familiar with your corporation . __eou__ In fact , in the past we only attended local exhibitions . __eou__ No wonder . __eou__ Here is our brochure . It'll help you get acquainted with our products and company . __eou__ Thank you ! __eou__
To get around your difficulty , Mr Smith . I'd suggest that you reduce your order by half . You can send in an additional order later . __eou__ Well , I'll consider the possibility . By the way , when do I have to open the L / C if I want the goods to be delivered in June . __eou__ A month before the time you want the goods to be delivered . __eou__ Could you possibly effect shipment more promptly ? __eou__ Getting the goods ready , making out the documents and booking the shipping space , all this takes time you know . You cannot expect us to make delivery in less than a month . __eou__ Very well , Mr Zhang . I'll not reduce my order . I'll take the full quantity you offer . And I'll arrange for the L / C to be opened in your favor as soon as I get home . __eou__ When will that be ? __eou__ Early next month . In the meantime , I should be very pleased if you would get everything ready . I hope that the goods can be dispatched promptly after you get my L / CB __eou__ You can rest assured of that . __eou__
Is there anything that you are interested in ? __eou__ Yes . Is this your new product this year ? __eou__ Yes . It's a prototype of our new product . It has got more advantages than the second did . __eou__ When is the product going to be on the market ? __eou__ It will be released next month . __eou__ So soon ? It seems to be in the early stages . __eou__ We have developed new technology about it . And the new product will be a pleasure to be hold . __eou__ Well , it's sounding good ! I'm looking forward to that . __eou__
I think we have everything in the contract . Shall we sign it ? __eou__ Wait a minute . I think we have missed an important point . We should include an arbitration clause in the contract . __eou__ I believe we can solve disputes through an amicable negotiation . __eou__ I hope so . too . But I still think the provision of arbitration is of great importance to both of us . __eou__ All right . I agree with you . But where do we hold arbitration ? __eou__ I suggest the arbitration be held in a third country . __eou__ It sounds reasonable . The clause should be like this - any disputes arising from the execution of this contract shall be settled in a friendly way . If no settlement can be reached through consul - nation and conciliation , the disputes shall be submitted for arbitration by a mutually nominated arbitrator . The arbitrator's decision on the dispute is final and binding on the both parties . __eou__ Ok . __eou__
What shall we do when we find a shortage in the shipment ? __eou__ You should do one of the two things - either to lodge a claim with the shipowner or with the insurance company . __eou__ Shall we leave it to the brokers ? __eou__ Yes . They usually do it . __eou__ Do they charge for that ? __eou__ Of course . In Europe , they charge a commission of 1 % of the amount of the claim for their service . __eou__ Is it the same in America ? __eou__ They do the work without charge to the importer . __eou__ It's part of their service , isn't it ? __eou__ Exactly . __eou__ Is it enough to claim with an on board bill of lading ? __eou__ No , you must also obtain a statement from the shipping agent certifying that the goods were actually loaded on their vessel for shipment . __eou__ I see . By the way , how do we prove the ownership of our goods ? __eou__ You must provide full original set of ocean bills of lading original insurance policy or certificate and the original commercia invoice . __eou__ I see . Thank you . __eou__ You are welcome . __eou__
Thomas , could you do me a favor ? __eou__ What's up ? __eou__ Could you pick up Mrs . David from Ford Company at the Capital Airport ? __eou__ Why don't you go ? __eou__ I'm supposed to do it , but the general manager called me last night . He said he couldn ’ t come back to Beijing as scheduled , so he asked me to attend the meeting for him . __eou__ I see . I'll do it for you . __eou__ Thanks a lot . It ’ s very kind of you . __eou__
What certificates of technical qualification have you got ? __eou__ I have got a computer engineer's qualification certificate . __eou__ Have you worked in a computer company before ? __eou__ Oh , yes , I have . I worked part-time as a typewriter in a computer company when I was at college . __eou__ Do you have any ideas on this work ? __eou__ In my opinion , it has a broad prospect and it needs smart mind . __eou__ Good ! __eou__
Excuse me , is this personnel division ? __eou__ Yes . What can I do for you ? __eou__ I came about your advertisement for a senior production planner . __eou__ What ’ s your name ? __eou__ My name is Li Jean . __eou__ You have been in Peking University , hadn't you ? __eou__ Yes , seven years . __eou__ What degree do you have now ? : __eou__ Master of Marketing Management . __eou__ Do you have any experience in this field ? __eou__ Yes . I worked at AB Company . __eou__ Why are you interested in the position ? __eou__ Because you need a senior production planner who is good at mathematics and fluent in English . I think I am fit for the position . __eou__ All right . If we decide to hire you , we'd pay you 5,000 yuan a month at the start . How do you think about it ? __eou__ That's very good . __eou__
Why do you want to be a tour guide ? __eou__ I like to travel and I also like meeting various kinds of people . __eou__ What courses have you completed at college ? __eou__ I have studied English , tourist culture , guiding methods and techniques and so on . __eou__ Have you learned any other foreign languages ? __eou__ Yes , I have learned Japanese as well . __eou__ Do you know that is a hard job ? __eou__ Yes , I know . But I don't mind working hard . __eou__ Is there anything you want to ask about ? __eou__ No . I only wish that you could give me a definite answer to my application as soon as possible . __eou__
You are still a student ? __eou__ Yes , but I will graduate from the Shanghai Finance and Trade school next month . __eou__ Are you sure you can be a successful cashier ? __eou__ I'm sure . You know my major is statistics and I get excellent records in all of the courses I have taken . __eou__ That's only for your theory foundation . I am afraid if you have ever handled large amounts of cash before ? __eou__ Yes , my father runs a business so I have opportunity to work in the finance department every holiday . __eou__ Good . I think you'll make a good cashier . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__
Hi , I am so glad to see you . __eou__ Are you kidding me ? Why do you say so ? __eou__ You know , I'm about to graduate and I have to look for a job as soon as possible . But I haven ’ t the faintest idea of how to go about finding a job . __eou__ OK . Let me see where to start . __eou__ I guess first I should prepare a resume , right ? __eou__ Sure . You should include your name , address and phone number in your resume . __eou__ Then what else should I put into my resume ? __eou__ Your job objectives , of course . In other words , what kind of job are you searching for ? __eou__ I got it . Then I should mention my educating background and working experience , should I ? __eou__ Yes . And don't forget to list them by date . Besides , you should begin with the most recent and then move backward . __eou__ I see . Is that all there is to it ? __eou__ No , it's also necessary to list a few related interests that are in some way connected to the jobs you want to take . __eou__ Oh , good point . You mean here I should show off my special skills and talents to impress the boss . __eou__ You said it . At last you ’ d better attach a list of references to your resume . __eou__ That's easy . __eou__ And one more thing , smile widely . __eou__
What do you think about our company ? __eou__ You are the leading company in the computer industry . __eou__ Why do you think so ? __eou__ First , your overwhelming share in the world market . Second , your superiority in sales and profits in addition to the amount of capital and the number of employees . Third , the diversity in your production line is second to none . __eou__ In what business are you most interested in this organization ? __eou__ In particular , I'm interested in marketing in the domestic field . __eou__
Have you had any experience with sales work ? __eou__ Yes , I have . In fact , I had worked for a foreign trade company for nearly two years , where I established business ties with several firms . __eou__ What exactly did you do at that company ? __eou__ Visit customers , dispatch consignments and things like that . __eou__ Did you like your work ? __eou__ Yes , I did . __eou__ But when and why did you leave the company ? __eou__ I left it two months ago . I didn't think I could learn much there , and there were not many opportunities for self-development . __eou__ I see . Why did you choose our company ? __eou__ I've been informed that there are many opportunities to develop myself in your company . Besides , I grew up in a city in the Northeast . I have lots of acquaintances in the region , which might help to push sales . __eou__
Where did you study accounting ? __eou__ I studied at Anshan University . __eou__ Did you intern anywhere ? __eou__ Yes , I interned with an accounting firm during tax season . __eou__ That must have been stressful . __eou__ Yes , but I learned a lot . __eou__ I'll bet . __eou__ I learned about different tax laws and how they work . __eou__
What does Human Resources Department do ? __eou__ Hiring , firing , training , insurances , benefits , retirement plans , salary , vacation . __eou__ They take care of a lot of things . __eou__ But most of time , they provide assistances . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ Say if the Engineering Department wants to hire a person , they will request HR to find candidates . __eou__ Yes ? __eou__ The Engineering Manager and his team will interview the candidates . HR will also be involved with the interview , but basically arranging the schedule and explaining the benefits . __eou__ OK . __eou__ Then the Engineering Manager will choose the candidate . __eou__ I see . __eou__
Could you please tell me how I can go job-hunting in the web ? __eou__ Generally speaking , job seekers can enter the websites either of job agencies or of some units for job advertisements . __eou__ How should I contact them ? __eou__ You can e-mail your application materials for application to the websites of job agencies for enrollment in their database . __eou__ Can I get a quick reply from the sites ? __eou__ Yes , usually it takes a short time , but you have to await the choice of the units for a while . __eou__
Hey Ted , I saw this ad in the paper . You should take a look . __eou__ What is it ? __eou__ It ’ s for a job . It looks perfect for you . __eou__ Let ’ s see ... ' Wanted , manager for up-and-coming firm . Must have good organizational skills . Experience a plus . Please contact Betty Sue . ' Oh , I don ’ t know ... __eou__ Come on , what have you got to lose ? __eou__ What about my resume ? __eou__ Here , I'll help you type one up . __eou__ Thanks , Mary . You ’ re a real pal . I'll call now to set up an interview . __eou__
Well , I ’ Ve looked over your resume , Mr . Peepers . __eou__ Please , call me Ted . __eou__ Well , Ted , this is a very impressive resume . However , we do have several other applicants to finish interviewing before we can make a final decision . We ’ ll call you by Friday , if that ’ s all right . __eou__ That ’ s no problem . __eou__ Do you have any other questions ? __eou__ Well , what kind of salary do you provide ? __eou__ Salary is based on experience as well as time spent with our company . __eou__ I see . __eou__ Salary can be negotiated once we officially offer you the job . __eou__ Sounds fine . __eou__
Mr . Dick . Does the recommendation of the university play an important role ? __eou__ Yes . In fact , the recommendation letter written by the university is an indirect self-recommendation . In the long period of cooperation , the university has established good relationship with the companies or organizations , they trust each other well . If your university recommends you , you can be approved more easily . __eou__ But I find that most of the recommendation letters written by universities are the same . So I doubt its authority . __eou__ More and more persons have the same discoveries since most universities do that in order to save energy . If your university also does like this , you can look for other methods , because such kinds of recommendations say nothing for you . __eou__ Could you tell me whether or not I send out my resume with it ? __eou__ It depends . If it has something special or useful , I suggest you send it out . __eou__
Anything else ? __eou__ Yes , one last thing . How much holiday time do you give your employees every year ? __eou__ Our employees receive fifteen days of paid vacation every year . If you don ’ t use the full fifteen days , they carry over to the following year . __eou__ How about sick days ? __eou__ You get five paid sick days . __eou__ Any other benefits ? __eou__ Yes , we have an excellent retirement plan and medical insurance as well . __eou__ Great . Thanks so much for your time . __eou__ We ’ ll contact you soon , Ted . Thanks for coming in . __eou__
Can you put me through to Mr . Lining ? __eou__ Yes , speaking . Can I help you ? __eou__ I am calling to let you know that you are selected to fill the position of Project Manager . __eou__ I am happy to hear that and I'll accept that . __eou__ By the way , are you married ? __eou__ No , I am single . __eou__
Were you engaged in any activities at college ? __eou__ No , I had no interest in the activities in college and I spent most of my spare time reading in the library . __eou__ What kind of activity would make you get involved ? __eou__ None , I guess . My only passion is on reading . __eou__
Have you got any certificate of technical qualification ? __eou__ Yes , I have obtained an accountant's qualification and a driver's license . __eou__ How long did it take you to get your driver's license ? __eou__ I spent a year to get my license . __eou__
That's all the general information of our company . I think you already have good knowledge about our company . __eou__ Yes , I have an overall understanding . __eou__ When we have the final results , we will call you . __eou__ Then when will I get a reply at the latest ? __eou__ If you pass the interview , the personnel department will inform you within two weeks . __eou__ But if I don't pass , will you call me ? __eou__ I'm sorry we won't . You can wait for two weeks . If you don't get a telephone call , it means that you weren't successful . __eou__ Then do I have the chance to get this job ? __eou__ I'm sorry but I can't make the final decision myself , and I have to discuss it with other interviewers . __eou__ I know . No matter what the result will be , I have learned a lot from our conversation . __eou__ Your mentality is very good and that's great . __eou__ Thanks for giving me the opportunity of this interview . __eou__ My pleasure . __eou__
What is the great trait in your personality ? __eou__ I suppose my strong point is that I like developing new things and ideas . __eou__ So you may like inventive jobs . __eou__ Yes , I like inventive jobs and I am capable and responsible . __eou__
Please tell me how to file things according to the concerned rules . __eou__ Well , all right . There are four points you should keep in mind when you file documents , information and other things . __eou__ What are they ? __eou__ They are , keep the documents in chronological order , remove all the chips and pins , punch the documents evenly and place them in the folder . __eou__ And what is the most important point ? __eou__ You should always remember that one customer on file is the rule . __eou__
What are your plans for the future if you are hired ? __eou__ I'll do my utmost if I am hired . __eou__ Do you have any short-term goals ? __eou__ No , that thought doesn't cross my mind . __eou__
Are you a goal-oriented person ? __eou__ Yes , I am . That's why I make plans before I do anything . __eou__ How do you plan to do your present job ? __eou__ I want to make more contact with extra clients and use my organizational skills in the future . __eou__
Excuse me , could you please show me the way to the human resource department ? __eou__ Yes , but have you made an appointment ahead ? __eou__ Yes , of course . I am Monica . I have made an appointment with your HR manager . __eou__ Just a minute please . I ’ ll make a call to the HR office . __eou__ Yes , they confirm your appointment . Please come in . It is on the 3rd floor , room 3106 . You can take the right elevator as the left on is in maintenance today . __eou__ Thank you very much . __eou__ You ’ re welcome . __eou__
Hello , this is Lucy from ABC Company . Is this Monica ? __eou__ Yes , it is . __eou__ I am calling to inform you that we have arranged an interview for this accountant position at 2 PM this Thursday afternoon . Please come on time . __eou__ Ok , thank you . By the way , could you please tell me how I can get there from A community ? __eou__ Oh , you can take the subway , get off at B stop and walk north for several minutes . You will find a building . It will take about 40 minutes in total . __eou__ I got it . Thank you so much . __eou__ You ’ re welcome . __eou__
Decent dressing and appearance , which contribute to a good first impression of the interviewer , are surely quite important . __eou__ Of course . Generally speaking , dressing should be tidy and neat , and match well with your identity , age , and experience . __eou__ Whatever you wear , it should perfectly reflect your confidence and vitality __eou__ Professional suits may be the best choice . __eou__ Gentlemen should wear western-style suits in the interview , which will help you look handsome . __eou__ Ladies should wear professional suits , either classical style or free style . It would be appropriate to wear a little or no make-up . __eou__ But those fashionable and shiny clothes should be avoided . __eou__ Name brand is not necessary . Anything decent will be fine . __eou__ You should present the best of yourself in order to achieve success in the interview . __eou__ Only when you dressing keep in accordance with that of other people around can you feel harmonious and relaxed . __eou__ In a word , dressing and appearance are indeed important , but it should never be all . __eou__ In other words , too much emphasis on it is undoubtedly to neglect the essentials . __eou__
Well , to come straight to the point , could you tell us something about your new price ? __eou__ Most willingly . It's 600 dollars per ton . __eou__ That's a high price . __eou__ But you know , the price of this article has soared up since last year . __eou__ I know . But I must say it's still unacceptable . Couldn't you make a discount for me ? You see , we have such a long-term cooperation . And our business could be mutually beneficial . __eou__ OK . I can make a special offer for you . This price is based on careful calculations . And it is the lowest price we can offer to you . __eou__
Did you have any publications ? __eou__ Yes , I wrote a thesis entitled English Education in High School and it was published in the Education Magazine . __eou__ Have you received any honors ? __eou__ Yes , I was chosen as a Three Goods student many times in college . __eou__
Brandy , I am supposed to participate in an interview tomorrow . __eou__ That's great . You need to prepare for it . __eou__ How ? __eou__ Buy an expensive suit . __eou__ Is a white shirt OK ? __eou__ Yeah , fine . And dressing leather shoes . __eou__
Excuse me . What should I wear if I want to go to an interview ? __eou__ You should wear a tie to go with your suit . __eou__ I am afraid I would tense up during the interview . __eou__ It doesn't matter . Just do your best to sell yourself . __eou__
DM210 is equivalent to 400 RIB . __eou__ Don't you wish to employ RIB of ours ? US Dollars might be adopted . __eou__ Are you afraid of losing money due to exchange rate fluctuations ? __eou__ I will give you a definite answer on the price terms two days later . __eou__
Peter , I hope you will accept my quotation for the air freshener . __eou__ I wish I could place a monthly order for a minimum of 50 cases , introducing your goods to my customers , but your price , $ 100 for a case , is too high in this highly competitive market . __eou__ I have cut the price the minimum . You know our freshener is a patent product , different from other kinds of fresheners . We could not have quitted it at such a low price if it were not for your past large orders . This price , actually , leaves us with a very small profit . __eou__ People here desire medium-priced air freshener only . Please carefully consider my proposal , which will lead to a larger business between us . __eou__ The low price I'm offering you is as low as I can go . __eou__ Then , I am sorry to say I must regretfully decline your offer and seek quotations for the other suppliers . __eou__ I'm sorry , Peter . I hope you'll continue to approach us on other occasions if you cannot accept our offer now . __eou__ Yes . I'll welcome other opportunities to do business with you . __eou__
Can I help you , sir ? __eou__ Yes . I want to rent a formal suit for an interview . Can you give me some advice ? __eou__ Yes . You should rent a brown suit and a black shirt . __eou__ May I try this on ? __eou__ Yes . Let me help you . __eou__
Hey , Michael . Remember me ? I'm Becky . We used to work at Lemans together . __eou__ Oh , sure . How are you ? Long time no see . How are things at Lemans ? __eou__ It's about the same . I've been thinking of making a change myself . Do you mind if I ask you a few things about your job at the university ? __eou__ No , not at all . Go ahead . __eou__ Well , I was wondering what the salaries are like ? I mean ... are they much lower than the corporate world ? __eou__ Well , I can't speak for all universities , but my salary is a definitely lower than at Lemans . I just don't think the salaries are comparable when you leave a major corporation . __eou__ Yeah , that's what I thought . But , I've heard that the perks are better . I was wondering if that was really true . __eou__ I'd have to say yes and no on that . I don't get a big end-of-the-year bonus like I did at Lemans but I get to take classes for free if I want to . I've always wanted to get a graduate degree so I'm taking classes now to do that . __eou__ Oh , that's great . It sounds like you're really happy with your move . __eou__ Yeah , I guess I am . Working at a university is really suits me . __eou__
I want to rent a formal suit here.Do you have a purple dress here ? __eou__ Yes . What size are you ? __eou__ I am a size 6 . __eou__ Try this on please . __eou__ This is just my size . How much is the rent __eou__ The rent is 400 yuan a day . __eou__
I'm sorry , but I don't think this damage is our fault . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ It looks like the shipping company did this . __eou__ We'd better take it up with them , in that case . __eou__
We're sorry , but we cannot allow your claim . __eou__ Why not ? __eou__ The material was not damaged by us . __eou__ We'll have to talk this over some more . __eou__
Just whose fault is this damage ? __eou__ The order was in good shape when it left out factory . __eou__ It certainly didn't arrive here that way . __eou__ We'll make it right with you , of course . __eou__ How about taking the damaged portion at a lower price ? __eou__ What kind of price did you want ? __eou__ I was thinking of 30 % off . __eou__ That will probably be Ok . __eou__
Could I ask some questions regarding to the social benefits ? __eou__ Go ahead , please . __eou__ How long is my paid vacation every year ? __eou__ You'll have 10 days paid vacation every year . __eou__ What about the insurance and housing policies ? __eou__ We will provide you with life insurance , health insurance , accident insurance , housing benefits , heating allowance and transportation allowance . __eou__ How often is the bonus ? __eou__ You ’ ll be paid a bonus at the end of every year . __eou__ Do I have training opportunities ? __eou__ We provide our employees with training opportunities at home and abroad . __eou__ Well , I don ’ t have any other questions so far . I would like to think for a couple of days before I give you my final answer . __eou__ Sure .

Mr . Li , does the recommendation of the university play an important role in job hitting ? __eou__ Yes . In fact , the recommendation is a way of indirect self-recommendation . The university and the business have a long-term relationship . If you are recommended by your university , you can be approved more easily . __eou__ But I doubt the authority because most of the recommendation letters of the university are the same . __eou__ More and more people have the same discoveries since most of the universities do that in order to save effort . __eou__

Excuse me , I want to know what's your price per dozen for exercise books ? __eou__ 15 dollars per dozen __eou__ Oh , it's rather too high . We have another offer for a similar one at a much lower price . __eou__ However , the quality of our exercise books is better than others . I can assure you that our price is the most favorable . A trial will convince you of my words . __eou__ If you can go a little lower , I'd be able to give you an order on the spot . __eou__ This price of yours is out of the question . You must know that the cost of production has risen a great deal in recent years . __eou__ I hope you'll give a second thought to it . __eou__ We'll have to discuss the problem later . __eou__ What about if we order a large amount of exercise books ? __eou__ Could you give me an idea of how larger an amount you want ? __eou__ About 300 dozens . __eou__ Then , let me check . For the large quantity you ask , considering the cost of raw materials , I think 13 dollar is our bottom line . And I can assure you this is the lowest price in the market in nowadays . __eou__ OK . That's a deal . __eou__
So how did your end-of-the-year review go ? __eou__ Oh , it was okay . I had my meeting with Mitch this morning and his bottom line is that he thinks I need to show more initiative . He thinks that I need to start being more creative . __eou__ Did he actually say that ? __eou__ Well , not in so many words . But I know that productivity is a big issue for him . Oh , he said the usual things like “ Keep up the good work ” and “ Thanks for your hard work , ” but he also said that he's thinking about bringing some employees into my department . That , to me , means he's not satisfied with what I've been doing . __eou__ Are you sure you're not reading too much into what he said ? __eou__ No , I Don't . Either I shape up or my job is on the line . __eou__ Well , I think you may be overreacting . Mitch likes to give everybody constructive criticism and I think that's what he was doing . __eou__ Do you really think so ? __eou__ Yes , I do . If you ask around , other people will tell you the same thing . __eou__ Maybe you're right . Thanks , Don . I feel better . __eou__ I'm glad to hear it . __eou__

It is very impolite and will make you nervous . __eou__ Proper posture can show your confidence . __eou__ The best would be you have a smile on your face in the interview to win a good impression of the interviewer . __eou__ Pay attention to keeping eye contact as well . __eou__ Throughout the interview you should maintain patience . __eou__ In a word , you should keep decent manners in the interview . __eou__ Only in this way can you leave the interviewer a good impression and achieve success . __eou__

It is convenient and fast . __eou__ You could inquire about the results directly , but should be politely . __eou__ Certainly . __eou__ I think the letter of inquiry should be written briefly .

Did you get my email ? __eou__ I certainly did . Do you want to come in and give me some feedback about your weekend ? __eou__ Sure . __eou__ How did the business trip go ? __eou__ Well , to be honest , nothing is more stressful than going on a business trip with our boss . __eou__ I understand . The last time I went on a business trip with the boss , I didn't even have enough to eat ! __eou__ I also think the company is pretty cheap with travel expenses . I spent half of the weekend on a train ! Surely they could have afforded to buy a few plane tickets ! __eou__ Our company is quite conscious of the environmental problems that frequent flying causes . __eou__ I see . Well , then perhaps they could give me a few days off after a business trip . It was really tiring for me . __eou__ I can ask the boss about giving you the day off today . __eou__ Thank you . I can't imagine getting much done today . I'm just too exhausted ! __eou__ No problem . Did you bring any gifts back for your department ? __eou__ No , should I have ? __eou__

Shall we discuss the schedule in the lobby ? __eou__ All right . I'll see you in the lobby tomorrow morning . __eou__
So , Emily , how was your day ? __eou__ I don't think you really want to hear about it . __eou__ It can't have been that bad . Go on and tell me about it . __eou__ To be honest , it was horrible ! My manager is such a pain in the neck ! __eou__ Why ? What happened ? __eou__ Well , he made quite a few mistakes on the monthly report and when his supervisor found them , my manager blamed them on me ! __eou__ That's not very fair . What did you do ? __eou__ There wasn't really anything that I could do . There's always been a lot of bad blood between my manager and myself . If I had said anything , he would have fired me for sure . __eou__ Does he treat everyone in your department like this ? __eou__ He treats everyone pretty badly , but the way he treats me really takes the cake ! __eou__ Do you have any idea why he treats you worse than the others ? __eou__ I really have no idea . All I know is that the thought of him really curls my hair ! __eou__ Is there anyone else you can talk to about it at your company ? __eou__ Not really . I'm hoping to live with it for a while until I get a promotion . __eou__ That's very sensible . It sounds like you have a good head on your shoulders . __eou__ I try to be sensible about it , but it's not very easy . Sometimes you just have to grin and bear it . __eou__ That's so true . When you have a taste for success , you can't let dishonest people like your manager get in the way . __eou__
I have some good news for you . We've decided we'd like to send you to Shanghai on a business trip this weekend . __eou__ Oh . __eou__ Don't you think that it'd be a good thing for you to get out of the office foe a couple of days ? __eou__ Sure . __eou__ I thought you'd be a bit more excited about this . Everything will be paid for and I'll send my assistant with you to take care of everything for you . All you have to do is to get on the train tonight at 7 pm . __eou__ The train ? Will I be flying back then ? __eou__ Oh , no . We've bought your return ticket for you . I think you'll find it comfortable . __eou__ Will the train be very crowded ? __eou__ Oh no . the train hasn't been crowded at all recently . Besides , you're in first-class , so you'll be fine . __eou__ When is the first meeting then ? __eou__ They've scheduled the negotiation meeting for 9 __eou__ Where will I be staying ? __eou__ We've booked you a room in the same hotel as your meetings , so you won't need to deal much with the transportation system . __eou__ That's very sensible . Would it be alright if I left early today to prepare for the trip ? __eou__ That's not a problem . Have a nap if you can . You don't know how tight the schedule is for this business trip . __eou__
Well , what did you think about the last candidate ? Do you think we should hire her ? __eou__ She had a very impressive resume , but she seemed to lack the confidence that I think a good manager needs . __eou__ What made you think that she wasn't very confident ? __eou__ Did you notice the way that she avoided making eye contact with us while she talked ? __eou__ She was a bit nervous , I guess . What else ? __eou__ When she first walked into the room to greet us , she didn't shake our hands or introduce herself at all . I thought that was a bit unprofessional . __eou__ You're right . If she walked into meeting with our clients like that , it would make our company look bad , wouldn't it ? __eou__ It sure would . Did you also notice the way she slouched in her chair during most of the interview ? She had horrible posture ! __eou__ I agree . I guess I was paying more attention to her answers than her body language . __eou__ On top of that , she didn't seem to have any sense of people's personal space.She didn't keep enough distance between us during the meeting . __eou__ That's true . I guess we ’ ll have to keep looking for a manager then . __eou__ Don't worry , we ’ ll find someone eventually ! __eou__
Good afternoon , Mr.Stein . I wonder if you are free tomorrow evening ? __eou__ I'm not sure , but let me check my schedule ... Ah , no . I have nothing then . __eou__ Great ! Our president has asked me to come over to invite you to the banquet held in your honor at the Beijing Hotel at 7:00 . Here's an invitation card for you . __eou__ How nice of him ! I'll be delighted to go . But what time would be convenient ? __eou__ I'll be here to pick you up at 6:30 . __eou__ That's good . It's most thoughtful of you to do this , Miss Wood . __eou__ It's my pleasure . Well , then , see you tomorrow . __eou__

Good morning , Oriental Electric Limited . __eou__ Hello , this is Catherine . I am calling about the appointment with Mr . Liu for this afternoon . Something has just come up .

I am going to schedule it for that time and inform Mr.Liu about the change . __eou__ Thank you very much . See you tomorrow afternoon . __eou__ See you . __eou__
My warmest congratulations on your promotion ! __eou__ Thanks . It ’ s nothing special actually . __eou__ Don ’ t say that . It owes to your efforts and team spirit . __eou__ Oh , it was nothing . Anyone could have done it . I still have a lot to learn yet . __eou__ You are very modest . Best luck in your new position . __eou__ Thank you . I won ’ t let this promotion change me . __eou__
I have applied for a transfer . __eou__ Really ? Do you mean that you are leaving ? __eou__ Yes . I think it's time to move on .

But anyway I wish you every success at your new post . __eou__ Thanks . It's been a pleasure working with you . __eou__

I am not sure . __eou__ I feel quite embarrassed for having to request a pay raise so quickly . __eou__ Let me think . How much did you have in mind ? __eou__ 5 000 yuan per month . __eou__ That's a lot of money . Let me think about it carefully . __eou__
Excuse me , sir . I've made a tough decision and here is my resignation . __eou__ I am sorry to hear that . Why do you want to quit ? __eou__ I'm sorry to bring up my resignation at this moment , but I've decided to study abroad . __eou__ All right . Welcome back anytime . __eou__ Thank you , sir .

We're on the same team here , Elvin . I'm being nice because we need to get along together . __eou__ I know you , Zina . You're only nice when you want something . __eou__ If we want to beat WebTracker , we're going to have to work hand in hand . __eou__ To be honest , I'm starting to wonder if it's worth it . __eou__ You'd rather lose to WebTracker than do things my way ? __eou__ You said it , not me . __eou__

Make sure you won't lose your temper ! __eou__ Oh , so bad . I'm afraid I'll change the image of myself . __eou__ No , it's unnecessary . Just respect the staff and their own opinions . __eou__ But sometimes they offer some useless proposals , it's awfully useless . __eou__ Oh , no one is perfect . __eou__ That's right . I should speak to them in a polite way . __eou__ We have the equal partnership in team . __eou__ Thanks very much and you're very eloquent . __eou__ Thanks for saying that . __eou__

You studied mathematics at college for four years , and now you have a job working with your hands ! __eou__ Plumbing work requires mathematics knowledge , and creativity . I love this job . __eou__ I can see that . But I didn ’ t know you had experience in that line of work . __eou__ I didn ’ t , but I applied for an apprenticeship , and since I studied math , AND I have a good attitude 4 , my application was accepted . __eou__ Congratulations ! You do have the right attitude . __eou__
I've been so tired recently . I've been trying , but I don't think I'm up to this job . __eou__ You need to take a break , maybe a vacation . __eou__ Oh , yes , indeed . I've run out of steam . To be honest , I want to be in a different environment . __eou__ Is that so ? __eou__ Yes , I don't want to be stuck in a rut . I want to move on . __eou__ Have you decided ? __eou__ Yes . I want to get a better job . __eou__ Could you tell me why you want to quit ? __eou__ I quit just because of the dissatisfying salary and the trouble in getting along with my colleagues . __eou__ Oh , that's terrible . Do you want to get a higher salary in our company ? __eou__ I'm afraid not . I've promised my girlfriend . We'll travel southwards to find a job that offers higher pay . __eou__ OK , I'd like to say that I've really enjoyed working with you . However , I think you should work harder for your new job and then you can ask for higher pay . __eou__ Thank you so much for your advice . __eou__ And every best wish for your new job . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__
Hi , have you got the exact number of people who are going take part in this activity ? __eou__ Yes , there are 62 in totals , and 2 of them still can't be sure . __eou__ They always push the time . How many of them are over fifty ? __eou__ 6 . So we should give them special attention . Some of them don't have a good health . __eou__ OK , I see . As far as you think , how many buses should we get for them ? __eou__ 2 should be enough , for each one has at least 30 seats . There will be some seats to spare . __eou__ I'll call the bus charter later . And have you announced the itinerary of this journey to all of them ? __eou__ Yes , most of them think it's good . But , some people have different opinions . They consider we should arrange some challenging activities . __eou__ That's possible . At that time , they can choose any activity they like . __eou__ That's good . I'll tell them later . And what kind of medicine we should be prepared ? __eou__ Let me think ! Pills for carsick , traditional medicine for cold , some painkillers and something like that . __eou__ OK , we should get them ready this afternoon . __eou__ One more thing , have you got all people's phone numbers ? __eou__ Oh , God . I've almost forgotten . I'll get it done right away . __eou__
Would you like me to type it for you ? __eou__ Yes , please . That would be a great help . Are you sure you don ’ t mind ? __eou__ Not at all .

It ’ s all right as it is . __eou__
I haven't got enough for prosecuting him . __eou__ Why don't you find someone who is in the know . __eou__ I'm just thinking about that , but the trouble is , I don't know who is well in the know . __eou__ Did you ask his former sectary , Lora ? She knows a lot about him . __eou__ Thanks for reminding me . She's the right person to help me . __eou__
May I come in , Mr Sun ? __eou__ I ’ d rather you didn ’ t , Miss Yang . I ’ m very busy now . __eou__ Can I try later then ? __eou__ Yes , of course . __eou__ Is it all right for me to come in now , Mr Sun ? __eou__ Well , uh ... I ’ m still pretty busy , but ... all right . Come in . What can I do for you ? __eou__ Do you mind if I sit down ? __eou__ Not at all . Take a seat . Now what can I do for you ? __eou__ I want to leave the department . Do you think I could put info a transfer ? __eou__ Yes . But why should you want to do that ? __eou__ Do you mind if I speak frankly ? __eou__ Not at all . Go ahead . __eou__ Well . You see , I don ’ t like the office . I don ’ t like the staff . And I ’ m afraid of you . And I don ’ t want to go one . So may I put info a transfer ? __eou__ Yes . I ’ d be delighted if you did . __eou__
Well , thank you . Mr.Parry , for all your information . Just one more question . __eou__ Yes , sir ? __eou__ Do you play any sports or games ? __eou__ I used to play football regularly when I was at university . And I used to do athletics in the summer . __eou__ And what athletics did you play ? Can you remember ? __eou__ I was a runner-a long-distance runner . __eou__ And now ? __eou__ No .

Bob , did you see our supervisor ? I need him to sign this paper . __eou__ He is in his office , but you'd better choose your words carefully while talking to him . __eou__ What's up ? __eou__ Nothing . But he is in a bad mood today . __eou__ Thanks for the warning . __eou__ That's all right . __eou__
Have you found another job yet , Sally ? __eou__ No , I haven't , but I've seen several interesting advertisements in the paper . __eou__ What kind of job are you looking for ? __eou__ Either something in the hotel business or something to do with travel . __eou__ You haven't had any experience in either of those fields . __eou__ I know . But I'd like to try . Look , here are some advertisements that I've cut out . __eou__
Please take a seat . __eou__ Thanks . __eou__ Now what can I do for you ? __eou__ Well , I'm looking for a job . __eou__ Fine , but first I need some information about you . __eou__ What kind of information do you want ? __eou__ Well , first of all , your name .

The next course starts a week from tomorrow . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ Good luck to you . __eou__
Good morning . __eou__ Er , good morning , yes , er ... __eou__ I'm phoning about the job that was in the paper last night . __eou__ Oh , yes .

Hello . Is Bob there , please ? __eou__ Hold on a second please . I'm sorry . He has gone out . __eou__ Oh . This is Paul . When will he be back ? __eou__ He will be back at about seven o'clock . __eou__ Can I leave a message please ? __eou__ Yes , certainly . __eou__ Please tell him I'll call him at the office tomorrow afternoon . __eou__ All right . I'll tell him when he comes back . __eou__ Thank you very much . __eou__

It's urgent . __eou__ OK , I'll have Mr.Baker call you as soon as he comes back . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ You're welcome . __eou__
Good morning ! __eou__ Can I speak to Miss Cooper please ? __eou__ Would you hold on a second , please ? Miss Cooper's extension is engaged . __eou__ Engaged . Oh , dear ! Could you tell her it's a long-distance call ? __eou__ I'm sorry , sir . I can't interrupt her . I'm sure she won't be very long . __eou__ How long do you think she'll be ? __eou__ I really can't say how long she'll be . __eou__ Can I leave a message , please ? __eou__ Yes , certainly . __eou__ Can you tell her I'm waiting to speak to her ? __eou__ Yes , sir . I'll ring her on an inside line if you like . __eou__ Thank you very much . __eou__

What about French ? __eou__ No , I can ’ t speak French . But I can speak Italian , not very well though . __eou__ ... Can you start next week ? __eou__ Next week ? __eou__ Yes , on Monday . __eou__ You mean I have the job ? __eou__ Yes , that ’ s right , you have the job now . __eou__
So will you back me up if things get ugly with Elvin ? __eou__ I will if you tell me how you're so sure that we're going to come out on top . __eou__ We just will.Trust me on that . __eou__ After what you did , I don't know how hard Elvin's going to work to meet your deadline . __eou__ He'll do it . He's too proud not to . __eou__ You've got everyone figured out , don't you ? __eou__ Yes , I do . Everyone . __eou__
I ’ d like to apply for a secretarial position . __eou__ Very well , do you know any shorthand ? __eou__ No , but I can write very fast . __eou__ Can you use the computer or other office machines ? __eou__ No , but I ’ d like to learn how to use them . __eou__ Yes , I see , this is a permanent position . __eou__ Can you work every day from 9 to 5 ? __eou__ Oh , no , I ’ m student at a university , and I have to study most of the time . I can only work part time . __eou__ I couldn ’ t possibly hire you . You can ’ t take shorthand , you can ’ t use a computer , and you can only work part time . __eou__
Hi , Zina . I had a feeling you'd be stopping by . __eou__ Then you've heard from Vital ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ Look , Vince . I didn't mean to step on your toes , but we need to be decisive . __eou__ I know it . WebTracker is playing for keeps . They'll go for our jugular if we give them the chance . __eou__ This is awkward , I know . I know you're upset . But in two weeks you'll be thanking me . __eou__ Maybe . Maybe I will . __eou__
I don't make idle threats . __eou__ I guess not . __eou__ I hope you're not turning into a sissy on me , Dave . __eou__ Look , I want to succeed just as much as you do . Well , maybe not quite that much . __eou__ If we let Vince and Elvin continue to run things , invoking is going to fail . __eou__ What are you trying to say ? __eou__ I'm saying this ship needs a new captain . Are you with me , or aren't you ? __eou__
May I come in , Mr Sun ? __eou__ I ’ d rather you didn ’ t , Miss Yang . I ’ m very busy now . __eou__ Can I try later then ? __eou__ Yes , of course . __eou__ Is it all right for me to come in now , Mr Sun ? __eou__ Well , uh ... I ’ m still pretty busy , but ... all right . Come in . What can I do for you ? __eou__ Do you mind if I sit down ? __eou__ Not at all . Take a seat . Now what can I do for you ? __eou__ I want to leave the department . Do you think I could put info a transfer ? __eou__ Yes . But why should you want to do that ? __eou__ Do you mind if I speak frankly ? __eou__ Not at all . Go ahead . __eou__ Well . You see , I don ’ t like the office . I don ’ t like the staff . And I ’ m afraid of you . And I don ’ t want to go one . So may I put info a transfer ? __eou__ Yes . I ’ d be delighted if you did . __eou__
Do you really think we can beat WebTracker ? __eou__ Of course . __eou__ How can you be so sure ? Do you know something I don't ? __eou__ I have a plan for handling WebTracker . Step one is the Stars.com contract . __eou__ What's step two ? __eou__ Don't worry about that , Dave . Look , I have to see Vince now . Think about what I said . __eou__
I want to offer you more invoking stock options . __eou__ When you hired me , you knew you were going to be low on cash , didn't you ? __eou__ Let me explain . To get more cash , I'll have to borrow more from Vital , the venture capitalists . __eou__ I know how it works . You don't want to give away any more of your future profits than you have to . __eou__ Exactly . Instead of increasing their position , I want to increase yours . __eou__
Hi , boss . You wanted to see me ? __eou__ Zina . Look , I know when I hired you , I told you I'd pay you a salary . But I just can't . __eou__ Excuse me ? I hope I didn't just hear what I think I just heard . __eou__ I know it's awkward , but you're going to be thanking me later . I'm going to make you rich . __eou__ You're going to make me rich by not paying me ? __eou__
Please take a seat . __eou__ Thanks . __eou__ Now what can I do for you ? __eou__ Well , I'm looking for a job . __eou__ Fine , but first I need some information about you . __eou__ What kind of information do you want ? __eou__ Well , first of all , your name.What ' s your surname ? __eou__ Wilson . __eou__ And your other names ? __eou__ Steven Michael . __eou__ Have you got your e-mail address ? __eou__ Yes , It's Henrylee@yahoo.com . __eou__ How old are you ? __eou__ Twenty-one . __eou__ Where were you Bron ? __eou__ In California . __eou__
Good afternoon , Mrs.Vale.Please sit down . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ Did you work as a salesperson before , Mrs.Vale ? __eou__ Only as a clerk in a store . __eou__ I see . Well , consulting is a little different . __eou__ I'm a quick leamer , Mr.Jenkins . __eou__ Umm hmm.Do you have a diver's license ? __eou__ Yes , and I'm a very good driver . __eou__ Fine.We provide a company car for our consultants . __eou__ Do I have to travel a lot ? __eou__ Oh yes-five days a week.You have to visit customers all over the territory . __eou__ But how will I get to know the products ? __eou__ You'll have to attend a three-week course . If you do well , the job is yours . __eou__ How much is the salary ? __eou__ Starting salary is $ 150 a week-plus commissions , of course . __eou__ How much commission do your consultants get ? __eou__ Five percent . __eou__ Well , I'm very interested in the job . __eou__ Fine.The next course starts a week from tomorrow . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ Good luck to you . __eou__
Can I leave early today ? __eou__ Sure . I don ’ t mind . __eou__ And can I come in late tomorrow ? __eou__ I don ’ t see why not . __eou__ And may I take Friday off ? __eou__ Go ahead . It ’ s OK with me . __eou__ One more thing . Would you give me a ten-dollar raise ? __eou__ No . __eou__
Good morning . Can I see Mr Jackson , please ? __eou__ Well . Have you got his permission ? __eou__ Yes . We have an appointment at eight o ’ clock . __eou__ What ’ s your name , please ? __eou__ Robert . Philips Robert . __eou__
Good morning . __eou__ Er , good morning , yes , er ... __eou__ I'm phoning about the job that was in the paper last night . __eou__ Oh , yes.Erm , well , could you tell me your name , please ? __eou__ Oh , Candida Fawcett . __eou__ Oh , yes.Erm , well , what exactly is it that interests you about the job ? __eou__ Well , I just thought that it was right up my street you know . __eou__ Really , hmmmm.Erm , well , could you perhaps tell me a little about yourself ? __eou__ Yes , arm , I'm 23 . I've been working abroad , I'm um ... __eou__ Where exactly have you been working , please ? __eou__
Hey Lisa ... want to grab lunch with me ? __eou__ Sure , Emily . We haven't done that in a while . __eou__ Yeah ... actually , we haven't hung out at all recently . You seem sort of under the weather . Is there something going on ? __eou__ Well , keep this under your hat , but I think I'm going to quit after New Year . __eou__ Quit this company ? Oh ... wow . __eou__ I know I should be pretty happy here , but I'm not finding the kind of job satisfaction I need . I'm a good graphic designer ... __eou__ One of the best in the company . __eou__ That's kind of you to say . But ... the stuff we do here hasn't really challenged me very much at all . __eou__ Oh , I get it . Simply put , you're bored , huh ? __eou__ That's one way of putting it . For me , a job needs to stimulate my brain , otherwise it becomes a daily drudgery . __eou__
Good.Now what kind of job do you want ? Mr.Wilson ? __eou__ I don't mind really.Perhaps a job in a shop or a factory . __eou__ Well , I know Brown's Biscuit Factory are looking for a porter.They pay $ 200 a week . __eou__ That sounds all right . __eou__ Good.Now here's the address of the factory.The manager's name is ... __eou__
No , Dave . I haven't wrecked my jeep . I'm calling to offer you a job . __eou__ With invoking ? No , thanks . __eou__ I'd like you to manage a new online auction site we're building . __eou__ I'm not interested , Zina . __eou__ Don't play hard to get . The pay is good . You'd be working with Elvin again . __eou__ I don't think so . __eou__ Elvin doesn't hold a grudge , if that's what you're worried about . __eou__
Hey , Ken ... I need to talk to you . __eou__ Sure ... what's up ? __eou__ Can we step into the conference room ? This is a more private conversation . __eou__ Sure ... __eou__ Ok ... I'm just going to lay it all out on the table , What do you think of Vincent's management style ? __eou__ Well , Vincent has only been CEO for a couple of years and ... well ... um ... __eou__ I don't want to put you on the spot . Here's what I'm getting at , I don't think Vincent is the man for the job . __eou__ Really ? And what led you to this conclusion ? __eou__ As I see it , he lacks the proper vision . His style is more about survival , and he's not taking the company anywhere.He ' s treading water instead of swimming . __eou__ Well , I confess I've had my doubts about his abilities before . It seems he mainly got the job because his famous aunt pulled some strings . __eou__ I've been with this firm for 26 years and I'd hate to see it go down the drain due to poor leadership skills . __eou__ Me too . But what can we do ? This isn't a reality TV show ... we can't just vote him out . __eou__ Yes and no ... We can't ask for a show of hands on who thinks he should be fired , but we can introduce a vote of no confidence at the next board meeting . __eou__ Interesting idea . You might be on to something . __eou__
But how did you know I was working for WebTracker ? __eou__ When I was in LA , I met the WebTracker sales rep . __eou__ He couldn't have told you . Only a few people at WebTracker know about me . __eou__ The sales rep had a green note pad just like yours . He said everybody at WebTracker used them . __eou__ I can't believe it . I can't believe I fell into your trap . __eou__ We both may be snakes , Dave , but I'm just better at it . Among the snakes , I'm the sneakiest . __eou__
OK , let's find somebody then . __eou__ Good . I'll take care of it . __eou__ Wait a second , Vince . You know what ? Why don't you let me handle it ? __eou__ Are you sure ? Do you have somebody in mind ? __eou__ Yeah . Let me see if he'll do it , and I'll get back to you . __eou__ OK . Just keep in mind it has to be somebody who can get along with Elvin . __eou__ Don't sweat it . I know just the guy . __eou__
Come again ? What are you talking about ? Aren't we on the same team now ? __eou__ Guess again , Dave . I have no intention of leaving invoking . Never did . __eou__ What do you mean ? You didn't ? Oh , no ... No ! __eou__ That's right , Dave . I tricked you into giving a confession . And I've recorded every word of it . __eou__ But how ? So you knew all along I was with WebTracker ? How did you know ? __eou__ I saw your green post-it notes . Nobody else has them . __eou__
Do you want to know what really motivates Vince to be nice to me ? __eou__ OK . What ? __eou__ It isn't gratitude . It's fear . Vince is afraid I'll jump to a competitor . __eou__ You wouldn't do that . Would you ? __eou__ I might . Vince knows he needs to keep me happy . __eou__ What about your accounts ? __eou__
I think it's time for me to meet my admirer and make him face the music . __eou__ You do ? How are you going to contact him ? __eou__ I'm leaving him a message taped to my computer screen . __eou__ What does it say ? Do you think he'll see it ? __eou__ He'll see it . It says , I like sweets . Meet me at two thirty in the parking lot . __eou__ Can I spy on you guys from the window ? __eou__ No . But I'll fill you in later . Right now I have to find Vince . __eou__
Hi , Dave . You're early . __eou__ So you knew it was me ? __eou__ I had an idea . __eou__ Look , before we get into the secret admirer thing , I want to talk to you about WebTracker . __eou__ I'm sorry . I know you feel betrayed . __eou__ So you're really planning to quit invoking and switch over to WebTracker ? __eou__ My mind is made up . __eou__
My accounts go where I go . Vince knows that . __eou__ Wow . You are a real snake . __eou__ It's business , Dave . __eou__ I know , I know . Kill , or die , right ? __eou__ Right . The faint of heart should not apply . __eou__ I really feel sorry for that rhumba boy if he ever identifies himself . __eou__ So do I . __eou__
Hi , Zina . Lots of people are looking for you . __eou__ Like who ? __eou__ Like Elvin . He isn't too happy about what you promised Stars.com . __eou__ I've got it under control . __eou__ You do realize that it isn't humanly possible for us to finish by next week ? __eou__ What if you had three more top-notch programmers to help you ? __eou__ That would definitely make a difference . But Vince already said no . __eou__
Is it true that one of our competitors is planning to launch their tracking service next month ? __eou__ That would be WebTracker . We're heard they're almost ready . That's why we have to finish first . __eou__ Or they'll take over the market before we even get started . __eou__ Right . And that would be a total giga-bummer . __eou__ I guess we'd better get back to work . __eou__
Who has been here already this morning ? __eou__ Well , Vince dropped off some sales reports for you.Said you signed a big deal with HomeSupplies.com . __eou__ They're small fry . Tonight I'm going to LA to negotiate with Stars.com . That'll be big . __eou__ You're right . All the entertainment web sites follow Stars.com . __eou__ Who else has been here ? __eou__ Elvin stopped by to see me . __eou__ Elvin ? Which one is he ? __eou__
Vince . We're both busy , so I'm not going to beat around the bush . I need a raise . __eou__ I can't do that , Zina . You know I can't . __eou__ Bull . I're done my research . I know you still control more than 65 percent of invoking options . __eou__ Who told you that ? __eou__ That doesn't matter . I want at least 4 percent . __eou__
I guess I'm just a little nervous . I'm giving everything I have to invoking , and ... __eou__ and what if it doesn't work out , right ? __eou__ Exactly . __eou__ You need to quit thinking like a loser . invoking is going to kick butt .

Our company is going to do some cutbacks soon . __eou__ Really ? Where did you hear that ? __eou__ I met with the supervisor just this morning . I don't know , but I am a little worried . Who do you think will get sacked ? __eou__ I'm not sure ... well , first , it couldn't be George . He is such a kiss-ass . He'd wash the boss's dog if he asked . __eou__ No , it's not going to be George . I don't think it's Andy either . He is involved with the boss's sister in-law . And you know how whipped our boss is . __eou__ That's true . What about Lisa ? I bet there's nobody who could do a worse job than her . __eou__ Lisa ? No way . I've heard a rumor that she and the boss were having an affair . You know rumors can't come out from nowhere . __eou__ Well , okay . Then there is still Michael . But he's the boss ' pet after having the best sales record for three months in a row . It definitely won't be Michael . __eou__ No , that would be crazy . But then who will it be ? Oh dear , it must be me . I should have known it ! Why else would he have talked to me alone about the downsizing . What should I do ? I've got a family to support . __eou__ Well , it could be me too . But I am not too worried . This place is suffocating me with this boss being such a hard-ass and colleagues who barely know how to get dressed in the morning . It would almost be a blessing to be fired from this place . __eou__
Where are you from ? __eou__ I'm from Germany . __eou__ So you speak German , don't you ? __eou__ Yeah , but I can speak English , too . __eou__ Oh , I see . What other languages can you speak ? __eou__ A little French . __eou__ Good . __eou__
Hi , Mary , can I have a minute ? __eou__ Sure , what's up ? __eou__ Well , actually I want to tell you that I've put in notice . __eou__ Really ? Why ? __eou__ Many reasons . I've been here for too long . Next year will be my five-year anniversary . I want a change of setting . Besides , our company is downsizing . I don't want to stay on just to be let go . __eou__ But they wouldn't lay you off ! You are the most experienced project manager in the company . __eou__ Maybe . But that's not kept the new boss from breathing down my neck . To be honest , I've got a better offer from another company . __eou__ Oh that's great , congratulations ! What's your new position ? __eou__ Senior director of market research . In addition to a nice pay rise it has some nice perks , like a company car , one month paid vacation , and an apartment downtown . And it's an international company so I'll have lots of chances to travel and meet new people . I'm really looking forward to it . __eou__ Sounds a great opportunity . I bet that made the decision to leave a lot easier . __eou__ Indeed . But let's stay in touch . I'll let you know how things go . __eou__ Sure . __eou__
Good morning , Mr . Smith . __eou__ Good morning , Jamie . What time is it now ? __eou__ It is 9 o'clock now . __eou__ I see . What is today's schedule ? __eou__ You have two meetings today . One is at 10 am , and the other is at 2 pm . After the meeting , you will have dinner with Mr . Brown at the Chinese restaurant in Sister Hotel . __eou__ OK . Can you prepare things for the meeting in the meeting room ? Make enough copies of the handouts . __eou__ No problem . Do you need the OHP ? __eou__ Yes . I am going to show them some slides in the meeting . Can you call Mr . Brown to remind him of the dinner this evening ? __eou__ OK . Do you want to ask the receptionist to wait for our customers at the receptionist counter before the meeting ? __eou__ That would be great ! You are really a good employee . __eou__
Have you found another job yet , Sally ? __eou__ No , I haven't , but I've seen several interesting advertisements in the paper . __eou__ What kind of job are you looking for ? __eou__ Either something in the hotel business or something to do with travel . __eou__ You haven't had any experience in either of those fields . __eou__ I know . But I'd like to try . Look , here are some advertisements that I've cut out . __eou__
In order to extend our export business to your country , we wish to enter into direct business relations with you . __eou__ It's our pleasure . __eou__ Our hope is to establish mutual beneficial trading relations between us . __eou__

Is it all right for you ? __eou__ Yes , my name is Brian and my phone number is 5294870 . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__
Why did the boss come down on Joe like a ton of bricks . __eou__ He spoke evil behind his back . __eou__ How did he know that he had bad mouthed him ? __eou__ Someone told joe off . __eou__ He is then in a very difficult situation . __eou__ Sure . He ’ ll get the bag . I think . __eou__
Excuse me . Do you mind if I ask some things about work for this company ? __eou__ Not at all . Go ahead . __eou__ I've heard that the company is very strict with its staff.Is that true ? __eou__ Not really , so long as you follow all the regulations . __eou__ If you make mistakes in your job , you'll be fired . Is that right ? __eou__ No . Everyone has a chance to correct his or her mistakes . The most important thing is to be responsible for your work . __eou__ Working here involves a busy schedule and overtime.Is that true ? __eou__ Yes.That ' s true . We are always busy . The company attaches great importance to high efficiency . Sometimes we have to work overtime , but not always . And we have extra pay for extra work . __eou__ It seems that working in a foreign enterprise is not the same as I expected . Thank you for your help . __eou__
Who is on duty ? __eou__ I am , sir . __eou__ Your duty is to keep a check on those prisoners from now on . __eou__ Yes , sir . __eou__
We have successfully fulfilled our work plan . In fact , we are No . 1 in terms of market share . __eou__ You have gotten amazing success . Congratulations ! __eou__ I hope we can continue to get support from the departments concerned . __eou__ Without a doubt . Relevant department will try their best . __eou__
What are the requirements to apply for the position ? __eou__ Your major must be computer . __eou__ Do you think my educational background suits this position ? __eou__ Yes , I ’ m quite satisfied with your qualifications . __eou__ Does this job require that new employees take any kind of training course ? __eou__ Generally speaking , training new members is usually necessary . We offer our new employees a one-week training course . __eou__ Could you tell something about the job ? __eou__ Yes , of course . You will be responsible for the designing and developing new products and also be in charge of the evaluation of the software programs including complex software systems to ensure product features and operation complaints . __eou__ Oh , I see . I believe I can do the job well . __eou__
Most of our customers are foreigners . How many foreign languages can you speak , Elizabeth ? __eou__ Two . French and Spanish . __eou__ And how well can you speak them ? __eou__ Well , French was my best subject at school . I can read and write it pretty well . __eou__ And how about your Spanish ? __eou__ Well , it's not as good as my French . I can speak it reasonably well , but my written Spanish isn't very good . __eou__ I see . Well , we have a lot of Spanish customers , but you wouldn't need to write any Spanish here . __eou__ In that case , I'm fit for the position I think . __eou__
How will you ship the order ? __eou__ Air freight is the quickest and safest way , I think . __eou__ But the freight cost will be higher and that will affect the retail price . __eou__
Can you tell me a little bit about yourself ? __eou__ I am a graduate of a technical university and have been employed as a technician with Company # for approximately 10 years . __eou__ Please explain why you are interested in leaving your current position and please elaborate on your technical skills . __eou__ I am looking for a growth opportunity , which I feel is not available at my current employer .

Could you do something to advance your shipment ? __eou__ It's hard to say . But why ? __eou__ We expect the goods to be on the market before the end of December to catch up with the Spring Festival sales . __eou__ I can understand your position . We can not make any promise , but we'll try our best . __eou__
What's combined transportation ? __eou__ If the goods are to be transshipped from one means of transportation to another during the course of the entire voyage , it's called ' combined transportation ' . __eou__ Why is it necessary ? __eou__ It's simpler and cheaper to arrange multi-model combined transportation . __eou__
We'd better have a brief talk about the loading port . __eou__ We are always willing to choose the big ports as the loading ports . __eou__ What's your unloading port , please ? __eou__ As most of our clients are near Tianjin , we'd like to appoint Tangle as the unloading port . __eou__
When do you plan to deliver the goods ? __eou__ This weekend . __eou__ Please pay close attention to the safety of the shipment . __eou__ Don't worry about that.We have experience . __eou__
May I know how long will it take to get some more in from the factory ? __eou__ About 3 weeks . __eou__ When will you be able to deliver ? __eou__ By the end of this month , at the latest . __eou__
I'm calling to tell you that the merchandise ordered last month has not arrived yet . __eou__ I'm sorry , hold on a moment . I'll check it out . But we have already shipped it to you last month . Would you like us to contact the express company to know what's going on ? __eou__ Please find out the reason as soon as possible . We are in bad need of it . __eou__ Ok , I am terribly sorry for the trouble you are getting into.We will contact you first thing , once we know the reason . __eou__

What do you think we need to do to get our new branch office running well ? __eou__ First , I'd make sure that we have a good , local , corporate lawyer . He or she will know all the local laws and regulations . __eou__ That ’ s very important . A friend recommended a good law firm to me . We ’ ll need someone to hire staff . __eou__ I think that we should send one of our HR people to do that . I don ’ t think we should use an agency , because they won ’ t be familiar with the type of people we employ . Have we decide on the location of the branch office ? __eou__ Yes . We have . We chose the location in the northeast of the city , not too far from the airport and on the edge of the CBD . __eou__ Why didn ’ t we choose an office in the CBD ? __eou__ The offices there were too expensive . Have we negotiated any contracts yet ? __eou__ Yes . We ’ Ve signed two contracts with companies that we already do work for in other countries . We hope to sign another three this month . __eou__ When will the branch office open ? __eou__ Hopefully next month . Everything is a little rushed . We should be able to set up our branch office and expand our business quickly . __eou__ Has and advertising campaign been prepared ? __eou__ Yes , it has . We ’ re going to target the business community through business magazine . __eou__ I made plenty of business contract on my last visit and through the embassy . We should be able to get plenty of customers . __eou__
If we give you the job , what ’ s the most important thing you except to get ? __eou__ Well , I just want to enjoy what I ’ m doing it ’ s the most important thing to me . __eou__ Just this ? __eou__ Yes , because I think being interesting thing is the best teacher . Or have more opportunities to have career growth . __eou__ Do you want to get a promotion ? __eou__ Yes , of course . __eou__ Where would you like to be in 5 years ? __eou__ In five years , I ’ d like to be a senior manager of this corporation . __eou__ How do you plan to accomplish this ? __eou__ By doing whatever is necessary . __eou__
Well , tell me something of yourself . __eou__ What would you like to know , Mr . Green ? __eou__ What working experience have you get ? __eou__ In 2004 , I got a job in the sales department of a trading company near Guangzhou . I started a sales representative . A year later , I was promoted to the position of sales manager . I had that job ever since , which is just over a year now . __eou__ Oh , good . Irene , can you tell me why you plan to quit being a sales manager to work here as my assistant ? Don't you like your present job ? __eou__ Frankly , some part of it I enjoy very much , but I prefer something more professional . It happens that I have a friend working here in this company . She told me the export department was to recruit an assistant . I felt very excited at this news . That's why I'm here . __eou__
What is your great struck ? __eou__ I think I ’ m very good at planning . I manage my time perfectly , so that I can always get things done on time . __eou__ Why do you think you be a good fit or this job ? __eou__ Because I ’ m very competent in this area . __eou__ Can you working under pressure ? __eou__ Yes , I work well under pressure and find it dimly . However , I believe planning and probable management of my time can reduce tight deadlines . __eou__ Are you more a follower or a leader ? __eou__ I don ’ t try to go ahead of people and lead them , I ’ d rather cooperate with everybody else and get the job done by working together . __eou__
Billy , you are late again . __eou__ I'm sorry I'm late . I overslept . Is the manager here today ? __eou__ Yes he ' s in his office . __eou__ Oh , I hope he didn't notice me . __eou__ Don't take any chances . It'd be best if you told him and promised not to be late again . He's already mad at you for last 2 times . Any more and he might fire you . __eou__ You said it . It won't happen again . Do you really think he'd fire me ? __eou__ I think he might . You'd better go to his office . __eou__ You are probably right . I'll go right now and apologize . I try hard not to be late but it is difficult with Beijing traffic . __eou__ Good luck ! __eou__
A :: You must be Wily . It's nice to meet you . __eou__ B :: Nice to meet you , Mr . Wilson . __eou__ A :: Tim , please . Please be seated . __eou__ B :: Thank you . __eou__ A :: So , Wily , you have been with IBM for two years , ready for change ? __eou__ B :: Well , I think I'm ready for new challenges . __eou__
OK , so now the last point on our agenda . Jill , let's go over the profit and loss statement . __eou__ Great . Well , the main issue here , as you can see is that our expenses are through the roof . __eou__ Let ’ s see ... These numbers are off the charts ! What's going on here ! __eou__ Well , um , sir , the company expenditures on entertainment and travel are out of control . Look at these bills for example . Just this month we ’ Ve paid over twenty thousand dollars for hotel charges ! __eou__ OK , thank you . I ’ ll look into it . __eou__ The list goes on and on . Here , this is a bill for five thousand dollars for spa treatments ! __eou__ Thank you , that will be all . I ’ ll take care of it . __eou__ Look at this one sir , eight thousand dollars were spent in one night at a place called ” Wild Things ” ? ! __eou__ OK , I get it ! ! Thank you for your very thorough analysis ! __eou__
How do you think the report I wrote ? __eou__ Not bad . But there is more room for improvement . __eou__ I jumped the gun . __eou__ There were some gaps in your report . Please be more sorrow . __eou__ Yes , I overlooked some facts . I ’ ll be more sorrow . __eou__
How can we develop a new brand image with no direction whatsoever ? __eou__ With the fifty forwards he sent out today , maybe we'll inadvertently get inspired . __eou__ I guess this is a good excuse to surf the Net on someone else's dime . __eou__ Who'd have thought Bean would be this kind of e-mail fanatic ? __eou__ He must have just got online for the first time last week . He still thinks it's some kind of new toy . __eou__
So Vicky , how long have you held your present position ? __eou__ I ’ Ve been a secretary for two years , before that I was at university . __eou__ And how do you like working for IBM ? __eou__ It ’ s challenging , I feel I have learned a lot . __eou__ What ’ s strength do you bring to the job ? __eou__ I get along well with people , and I enjoy working with others . __eou__ That ’ s good . We always need team players here . __eou__
You look very professional in the suit . __eou__ The company regulates that men should wear a suit and tie in business meeting . Company policy is not negotiable . __eou__ I appreciate it . It is related to company image . __eou__
Could you give me an expense report ? I would like to attach the invoices for my phone bill this season . __eou__ Here you are . Do you need glue ? __eou__ That is very kind of you . I ’ m just running out of glue . __eou__ You ’ re welcome . __eou__
I met a girl in elevator this morning . She works in a company upstairs . She said she envied the casual way we dress for work . She complained about the dress rule in her company . It requires everyone to wear formal clothes from Monday to Friday . __eou__ Well , I was wondering where those people with professional attire come from . Now , I know the answer . __eou__ You know , in a sense , a suits and ties are compulsory for male employees even in July , and no jewelry allowed for most of the female employees . Even the reasonable male leaf is returning the rule , isn ’ t that strict ? __eou__ To some extent , it is . Anyway , whether they like it or not , they do give people a very good impression . __eou__ But it is unjust to judge a book by its cover . If they ’ re not happy or comfortable with their clothes , they can be less productive . __eou__
How do I submit an expense report ? __eou__ You need all your receipts for reimbursement . __eou__ You mean I have to attach the receipts with the expense report ? __eou__ Yes , here is the form for an expense report . Fill it out and give it to me . I ’ ll get it signed for you . __eou__
Let ’ s call it a day . __eou__ It ’ s nice to go home earlier once in a while . But now it ’ s the evening rush . __eou__ It ’ s hard to commute a long way . __eou__ Sure it is . I really hate to get caught in a traffic jam . __eou__
Are you familiar with the office management ? __eou__ I have done something like that before . __eou__ Are you still interested in it ? __eou__ I think I am . I left the job only because it was too far from my home . __eou__
Did you sign up for the picnic party ? __eou__ Yes , of course . I love the picnic party . It ’ s really family fun time . __eou__ This time you can bring your daughter with you . __eou__ Right , she is so excited and simply can ’ t wait . __eou__ There are times of games planned , should have a grand time . __eou__
We need to know whether you have the special training . __eou__ Actually , I received that kind of training when I was in college . __eou__ How about your experience ? __eou__ I worked as a PR clerk for one year __eou__
We need a person who knows how to operate and repair all kinds of office appliances . __eou__ I used to hold a similar job for six years . __eou__ So you're quite confident in your experience and skill __eou__ I think so . __eou__
May I have your resume , please ? __eou__ Yes , I need a job that can give full play to my skills . __eou__ Do you like a job in a library , working with books ? __eou__ I like peace.As a matter of fact , I once had a job in a library . __eou__
One thing I love our boss for is that he always knows when to give you a pay raise without being asked for . __eou__ Really ? How can he be so sure about the timing ? __eou__ He just knows either by your excellent performance at work or by the annual review . __eou__ Well . This must save lots of employees from worrying about how to write a salary increase letter . You know how tough it is . Do all the employees receive the same pay increase annually ? __eou__ Actually not ! Our company pays for performance . __eou__ I like this system . It will encourage the best employees and motivate those who want to make a change at work . __eou__
Congratulations , Francis . Your hard working finally pays off . I am so happy for your promotion . __eou__ Thanks , Monica . Without support from you and other colleagues , I would not have made it . __eou__ I hope I could get promoted some day . Tell me about your experience , ok ? __eou__ Well , just saying that you wanted to get promoted is not enough , you need to write down your desirable position and an available plan for achieving that adjective . Don ’ t be afraid of taking challenging . They might be opportunities and failing is not fatal . You learn more from that actually . Sometimes , you need to fail to be successful . __eou__ How do you think if I volunteer for some work ? __eou__ I think it is a smart idea . Our boss always likes it when employees take initiatives . __eou__
Francis , you have done an outstanding work in the past six months . In view of your achievement , I trust you ’ re now indispensable part of our company and you deserve an officer director title . __eou__ I am so happy to know that I could make some contribution to our company . __eou__ This title does not only give you a raising pay-check , but also increase responsibilities . Congratulations , and hope the best for you . __eou__ Thank you , I will be doing my best . __eou__
My computer isn ’ t running at the same speed it used to be , it is testing my patience everyday . Can you tell me how to make it run faster ? __eou__ If you want to speed up your system , you ’ Ve got to clean it up first . __eou__ How ? __eou__ You need to free your disk space . The simplest way is to use a Disk-Cleanup tool to remove temporary files and in store programs that you no longer use . Things should be fine next time you start . You also need to control what starts up . There is a program calls Start-up Delayer , It can help to set after how much time programs should be loaded after Windows boosts . For example , you can choose to set your Fox Mail program to load 30 seconds after Windows starts up . __eou__ Very useful advice , I will try them right now . __eou__
You have been doing a great job this year and I am very satisfied with your work . __eou__ I am very happy to know my work could be recognized by you and our company . __eou__ Based on your contribution , I would like to give you a pay raise . Your monthly salary will be increased by 800 Yuan . This increase includes an 80 % married increase based on your achievements and increase responsibilities and then the additional 20 % increase were reflecting the changes in cost of living . __eou__ I really appreciate it . Thank you . __eou__
Could you please cover for me two hours this morning ? __eou__ Sure . Any specific reason I should know about in case people ask where you are . __eou__ I have to see the dentist . We have an appointment for this morning from 9 to 11 o ’ clock . So if there is any phone call , please pick up for me . If there is something urgent , tell them I will be back in two hours . __eou__ No problem . Good luck . __eou__ Yes , I will need it . Thanks . __eou__
Hi , Lucy , you are very popular with people around you , what are your tricks ? __eou__ Thank you for saying so . I don ’ t know , probably because I like sharing my experience and knowledge with them . I think this kind of communication helps to improve our work efficiency and also helps to get along with colleagues . __eou__ Sharing knowledge can be very settled and some second stances . People may think you are telling them how to do their work . If they take it personally , they feel angry at you and even become reluctant to support you at work . __eou__ That is true . Some people will misunderstand your intention and lets you do it in the long threatening way . For example , it is not sensible at all to arguing with the others or correcting someone in front of other people . To show your friendliness and willingness to share is much more important than to show off . __eou__ You are quite right . Thank you for sharing your experience with me . I learned a lot . __eou__ You ’ re welcome . __eou__
You look really wiped out ? __eou__ I had meetings back to back all morning . And phone rang off the hook from the minute I walked into the office . __eou__ Not a good day . I hate to tell you that Mr . Thomas wants to see the profit ’ s statement for new project tomorrow morning . __eou__ I can ’ t believe it . I guess I ’ ll be here until 10 again tonight . __eou__
Could I ask you for a favor ? My laser printer is out of ink and I need to print out something urgent . If you don ’ t mind , I would like to send you these files . Could you then print these for me ? __eou__ Sure , just send me through internal mail . __eou__ Thanks , Vivian . __eou__ No problem at all . Welcome . __eou__
Hi , still in the office ? It ’ s already 7 . __eou__ I would like to go but I have to finish a very important presentation . Our boss needs it for tomorrow ’ s morning meeting and I was given the complete information only late this afternoon . __eou__ Sounds like our boss . Typically him always late with important information . Anything I can help ? __eou__ Oh , that will be great . Thank you so much . Please help me to double-check the name list . I have to make sure they are all correct . __eou__ Ok , shall I make a coffee first ? __eou__ Not for me . It is already late . I can not fall asleep after drinking coffee this late . __eou__
Hi , Francis , morning ! How are you doing today ? __eou__ I had a bad start of the day . I was stuck in a bad traffic jam on my way and I missed my morning meeting . __eou__ Indeed , I agree that is not a good start . How about the meeting ? You missed anything important ? __eou__ It is ok . My boss briefs me later on . __eou__ Was he unhappy with you not attending the meeting ? __eou__ Err , kind of . You know this traffic jam is really bad with so many new cars hitting the streets these days . __eou__
Did you punch in ? __eou__ Yes . By the way , you are having a great make-up today . I like the color of your lipstick . So adorable ! __eou__ Really ? It took me really a while to find the color . I am happy you like it . __eou__ Well , girls like us are happy to spend our time on those kinds of things . Actually , do we still have a meeting this afternoon ? __eou__ Sure , when those never ending meetings . __eou__
Hello , Mr . Thomas . Could you spare a minute ? __eou__ What do you need ? __eou__ I need to talk to you about that new driver you ’ Ve hired . I think I am going to have some problems working with him . __eou__ He seems to be quite qualified . If it is a personal problem I preferred if you would work out between yourselves . __eou__
Look , here is a very special business card from an illustrator . Every time I go through my book of business cards , I will notice it . It is an eye-catching one . __eou__ Wow , fantastic . I like the font and color for his name . It is creative yet personal . __eou__ Yes , it is a bold design . People will believe he can make an illustration as an impressive as a business card . It just stands out from those plain and standard ones used by government people or other big private and public organizations . __eou__ I agree . Business cards are great tools for promoting personal business . It won ’ t take much time to design an amazing card , but it can make a big difference among the crowd . And you ’ ll always notice it from your collection . For they have outspoken colors , own design and the sizes are not always according the mainstream business card . I wish to have one like this . But for sure our company has its own corporate design which all employees have to follow . __eou__
Congratulations ! I heard that you are going to take a two-week training course in the headquarter . __eou__ Thank you . I am very happy to have this opportunity to learn something new . You know information and knowledge in this field update very fast . __eou__ Sure it is . This is a changing world . Does the training course cover the new law and regulation issued last month ? They are very useful for us . __eou__ Yes , according to the agenda , there will be a seminar on these issues at the very beginning of the training course . __eou__ Well , good for you . I hope you can get what you want from the training . __eou__ I will do my best . __eou__
What ’ s the problem ? Things are getting out of hand . You keep sticking your nose where it doesn ’ t belong . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ Now , I am responsible for training new staff , but you keep overriding my authority by trying to pose your methods . I know you are a hotshot college graduate with something to prove . But I don ’ t like your way . __eou__
What is your most preferred training method ? __eou__ Well , I prefer active rather than passive training . For example , I like the training offered by a financial software company from which we bought the newest updated virgin . They sent the programmers to demonstrate how to do and then ask us to practice . All employees receiving this training were in the same meeting room , so we could communicate with each other . We had a lot of fun learning together . It helps to build up the work relation among colleagues . __eou__ Well , that is also very efficient , right ? __eou__ Of course , it is much better than just giving us some reading materials or information via the internet . __eou__ That ’ s boring . Once we were asked to watch a video on how to operate the punches , all of us seemed to fall into sleep by the end of the video . __eou__
Have you heard that we will have reorganization ? __eou__ No , really ? __eou__ Yes , flexible , aggressive and creative people are urgently needed in the marketing department . __eou__ Who will be there ? __eou__ James is going to be packed off there . __eou__ That is good . He can leave you alone this time . __eou__
The boss had an informal discussion with me this morning , I feel really down . __eou__ What ’ s up ? __eou__ Well , actually I failed to meet a deadline last week and I forgot to answer an e-mail for a VIP customer yesterday . __eou__ Anything that distracts you from work ? __eou__ Yes , everything . I feel overwhelmed by the daily work . Sometimes , I just can ’ t focus on what I am doing . What is worse , though I make plans for a whole week , I always have to make changes later on because other things come up . I can ’ t manage my time well . I can ’ t handle work well . I am afraid I was screw up more things . __eou__ Look , Lucy . Things are not so bad as you said . This is our company ’ s busiest time in a year . You need to relax a little . Don ’ t push yourself too hard , ok ? __eou__ Well , I will try . __eou__
How do you think a manager should react to an employee ’ s unsatisfactory work ? __eou__ If I were a manager , I would have a private talk with this employ to figure out the reasons . It is very important to have this one-to-one discussion in an unthreatening situation without any distraction . __eou__ Exactly , I overheard a manager scold his employee in the elevator this morning , they were from the company on the 12th floor , I guess . They were only three of us in the elevator , I felt very embarrassed to be in the middle of them . __eou__ Well , I guess the employee would feel more embarrassed and probably angry . Anyway , it is not wise at all to give a harsh time to your employee in front of others , especially strangers . __eou__ Sure , no matter what happened , they should wait to discuss in their office and find the solution in a positive way . __eou__
Some companies use to ban dating among employees , but now they have realized it is something in avertable . People spend so much time at work . It is not surprising for one to have a crash on the other . __eou__ If we think positively , office love can be beneficial to company . __eou__ Beneficial ? I don ’ t think so . If two employees get married , they will leave at the same time for a honeymoon , or later one of them will stay at home taking care of babies . If they break up , the company will probably have to relocate one of them to make the workplace more comfortable . By any means , the company must spare extra efforts to solve problems brought by an office dating . __eou__ But if two employees are in love , they will be happy . Happy people are more productive . If they develop an intimate relation with each other , they are willing to share knowledge and experience . It can help to improve work efficiency . __eou__ I doubt that . __eou__
How would you describe your relationship with our boss ? __eou__ We have a fairly good working relationship , but there was also a rough spot . __eou__ What do you think his strengths are ? __eou__ Well , he has an amazing ability to analyze information and he is very good at making the right decision in tough situations . __eou__
I am thinking about resigning from my current job . __eou__ Have you thought about it seriously ? __eou__ Yes , I have been thinking about it for quite a while . Now I finally make up my mind to leave . I have given my resignation letter to our boss last Friday . __eou__ Ok , did you find a new company ? __eou__ Yes , I will move on to XYZ Company . __eou__ Good for you , but your leaving will be a great loss to us . It is so nice to work with you . __eou__ Thanks . I had learned so much from you and our colleagues . __eou__
What is the most enjoyable part about your job ? __eou__ I think meeting people . There are people from all over the country , all over the world , all walks of life which is the most interesting part of my job . __eou__ What do you find annoying ? __eou__ Well , I work very long hours , ten hours a day is quite normal . And if something important comes up , I ’ m often in the office until 8 or 9 in the evening . __eou__
Hello , this is Francis from XYZ Company . I would like to discuss with you about a new project some time next week . Do you have time to meet ? __eou__ Well , I am not sure . Lets me check my agenda __eou__ Ok . __eou__ I am free on Tuesday afternoon from 2 PM to 4 PM , is it convenient for you ? __eou__ It is ok with me . So I will be arriving at your office around 2 fifteen PM . Do you have a projector in your room ? I would like to show you some related charts __eou__ Yes , there is . See you then . __eou__
Can I ask for leave this afternoon ? __eou__ What is the problem ? __eou__ I had a headache this morning . I didn ’ t pay attention to it . I thought probably it is because I didn ’ t sleep well . But now it is getting worse and worse . I feel quite dizzy now and my eyes are somehow very light-sensitive . Maybe it is the migrated . __eou__ It is ok . You look really pale and red eyes . I suggest you go home immediately and have a good rest . __eou__ Thank you very much . I am sure good rest will do indeed . I don ’ t have this too often . __eou__
I would like to ask for one day off next week . Do you think the manager will agree ? I know it is the busy time for our company , but I do have some important things to handle . __eou__ Well , it is hard to say . At least you need to come up with a good reason . __eou__ Actually , it is my mother ’ s wedding . My parents divorced many years ago . Now she is ready to establish a new family . It is a special occasion . I've got to be there , right ? __eou__ Yes , you should be there . Go find the manager and ask . I think the manager will understand and approve you a day off . Don ’ t forget to fill in the leave application form . It will be signed by the manager for approval . __eou__ Thank you so much . __eou__
You must be very busy these days . I heard you are responsible for the meeting arrangements this time . It can be the most important meeting for our company this year . __eou__ Sure it is . I am up to my ears as time expressed . __eou__ Do we still use the conference room in the same hotel as last time ? You remember ? I like that one . __eou__ If we were in the same conference room , I would not work late these days . That conference room has been booked out . This time our boss wants to hold the meeting in our company . So everything has to be rearranged and checked , like tables , chairs , mean tacks , podium , audio and visual equipments and even the lunch menu . __eou__ Good preparation will improve the effectiveness of the meeting . I am sure that your hard work will pay off . __eou__
What sort of job would you like to take ? __eou__ I prefer a sedentary job and I used to work as an operator . __eou__ We need an operator now . __eou__ It's just the job I've been searching for . __eou__
You must like negotiating a lot . People are saying , you are a super negotiator . __eou__ Ha , I am flattered . Actually , when it comes to negotiate , you don ’ t need to like it . You just need to understand how it works . __eou__ I am not good at it by any means . Give me some advice . __eou__ Well , generally speaking , if you want to change someone ’ s mind or understand his position , you have to put yourself in his shoes . Understand his need and the cost for his need . And then you work together to find a solution . __eou__ Sounds easy . But how can I apply to practice ? I am thinking about applying for more reimbursement for my mobile bill . But I am afraid our boss will turn me down . __eou__ Ok , as John after Kennedy put it , let us never negotiate out of fear , but let us never fear to negotiate . __eou__
I am so happy to know that the promotion campaign for our new product is very successful . We just made a record sale this season . __eou__ That is very encouraging news . I heard that the marketing department has done a three months research , they sent the feedback information to the research and development center by the end of every month . That is to say , the R & D center redesigned the product twice before it was launched into the market . __eou__ It is not an easy job . How do you like the advertisement for the new product ? __eou__ That is the best one I have seen . I am sure our target customers , young people will love it . __eou__ Certainly . __eou__
Here is the document you asked for this morning . __eou__ Oh , you are so efficient . I thought you might give it to me tomorrow . Thanks . __eou__ You ’ re welcome . You know , these days I have been reflecting on my biggest weakness procrastination . The more I think about it , the more I hate myself for being so disorganized . I decided to change the situation as soon as possible . Otherwise I will be more regretful later . __eou__ This is encouraging news , good for you ! What is your solution , then ? __eou__ The most useful method is to make plans and set priorities . It helps me to manage time well and get the most important things done at the first place . __eou__ Sounds not bad ! Better performance isn ’ t just about doing a lot more . It is about focusing on the right things to do . __eou__
Hi , Monica , congratulations ! Your presentation at the meeting was very successful and everyone was impressed by your speech . And it was so persuasive and I bet our clients will be convinced to invest their money in this project . You really made a big contribution to our company . __eou__ Thank you , I just tried my best . I am very happy to know you like it . __eou__ You must have been prepared for a long time . Some statistics in this presentation are not easy to find , right ? __eou__ Well , yes . Several colleagues from different departments helped me with that . They are very supportive . I consulted an economic expert last week . He was very kind to give valuable suggestions . __eou__ Now , the effort pays off . You have accomplished something . __eou__ Come on , don ’ t flatter me anymore . I took the job because I love being challenged . But I can ’ t get this turned around without the support from you people . __eou__
Do you want to sign for a Korea language class ? __eou__ What for ? Oh , I see , you mean next year our company will expand business to the South Korea market . __eou__ Right , we have located a business partner in Seoul . The first contact proves to be successful . The general manager of South Korean company has scheduled to pay a visit to us next month . I think it is quite possible to set up a joint venture company with them soon . __eou__ Well , sounds promising . But I think our company will provide us with the language training courses if it is necessary . We need not bother signing for the language by ourselves . __eou__ A slow sparrow should make an early start . You know , I am not quick at learning any language . __eou__
Which job do you prefer , an accountant or a secretary ? __eou__ Neither , I prefer an active job . __eou__ Then how about a salesman ? __eou__ That's better . I like travelling . __eou__
I really like what you have . But the price for this product is much higher than we expected . I am absolutely not a buyer at that price . __eou__ I know it is not the cheapest on the market . But if you take the quality factor into consideration , you will find your company will benefit in the long term . This device is built in with the most advanced technology . Every aspect has reached the international standard . It is a worthwhile investment . __eou__ I understand that . If you can lower the price by 10 percent , we have a deal right now . __eou__ Well , the best I can do is to lower the price by 5 percent if you are willing to pay 90 % cash of front and 10 % on delivery . That is our best offer . __eou__ Err , well , I can ’ t decide right now . Do you mind if I have a small internal discussion on this first ? I will tell you our decision this afternoon . __eou__ Sure , no problem . __eou__
Is the view going to be ok ? __eou__ Don ’ t worry , you did a good job and it should be fine . __eou__ I ’ ll do my best . __eou__ That ’ s the way to go . __eou__
I ’ d like to take this opportunity to thank you for everything you did for me . __eou__ It ’ s my pleasure . I enjoyed working with you . __eou__ I wouldn ’ t be able to make it without your help . __eou__ Then keep up the good work . __eou__
Are you doing anything tomorrow morning ? I'm wondering if you'd like to come to my office to discuss the new project . __eou__ Tomorrow morning ? What about tomorrow afternoon ? __eou__ Then I'll see you in the afternoon . __eou__ OK . __eou__
I think you should look over these figures again . There are some calculations that are a bit off . __eou__ I apologize . This should not have to be this way . __eou__ Apology is accepted . Try to do better next time . __eou__ Of course , I should have been more careful . I ’ m sorry . __eou__
We did a survey on your job performance . __eou__ How did I do ? __eou__ Not so good . Lots of complains . __eou__ Really ? I thought I was doing well . __eou__ Your performance so far is not quite in line with what we expect for our executives . I hope I ’ Ve made my point . __eou__
I'm really in a flap about the interview . __eou__ Take it easy.you ' Ve made enough preparations . __eou__ I'm in such a need of the job that I can't afford any mistakes . __eou__ I'm sure you'll pass it . __eou__
Hi , are you busy ? __eou__ Hi , I was just coming to see you.But since you made the trek to my office , you get to go first . __eou__ Okay , I'm putting together a report on the Allied Marketing Co . failure , and I seem to have run into a stone wall . Can you help me out ? __eou__ Well , I can try , what do you need ? __eou__ You were there when the problem started . I was hoping you could fill me in on the details . __eou__ Sure , no problem.But I need something from you . __eou__ Name it . __eou__ I'm supposed to have this package ready for mailing out tomorrow morning and I'm miles away from being ready.Can you edit this product study I wrote while I do these ? __eou__ All right , I can do that , and as soon as we finish this , we can both work on my problem . __eou__ That works for me . __eou__ Give me the study . I'll start as soon as I get back to my office . __eou__ Here's a print out of the study , and this is a disc with the full report on it.The file name is product study , this is and extra copy so you can do whatever you want with it . __eou__
Well , that's why you'r here.My source for big TV sets overcharged me on the last shipment , so I need someone new . I wanted to meet you to see if we can work together . I think __eou__ I agree . __eou__ Fine , but before you agree , don't you need to know what you're agreeing to ? __eou__ I guess you're right.But like you said , you called me here to check me out . I've been doing the same . __eou__ Ha , ha , ha ! That's fair.How did I do ? __eou__ Quite good , actually . I'm pretty sure you're demanding , but fair and honest . I feel we can work together . __eou__ Good , well , here's what I need from you . Are you ready ? __eou__ Shoot ! __eou__ Well , I know you work for someone else , but as your client , please , we have to get this straight between us . I'm your client , not your company.As your client , I expect you to be square with me at all times . Can you do that ? __eou__ I don't see a problem . __eou__ Good ! Do you have any questions ? __eou__
Both of the two young ladies are the candidates for the position __eou__ The question is we only need one . __eou__ Right.The choice is yours , the tall one or the short one ? __eou__ I should take the taller one for the choice . __eou__
Hi , Bill.It ' s Marsha Black at MPPD Ltd.How are you ? __eou__ Hello , Marsha . I'm great and you ? __eou__ Not too bad at all.Do you have a minute ? __eou__ Sure , what can I do for you ? __eou__ We're ready to place our Christmas order and we need a formal bid . __eou__ So this is a real thing ? __eou__ Right , this is not a drill . This is for all the marbles . __eou__ When do you need it ? __eou__ ASAP , in writing of course . __eou__ Sure , who am I bidding against ? __eou__ The usual guys , so you better use a sharp pencil . __eou__ Okay , give me a week and I'll have time to get my pencil real sharp . I should have some new figures from Malaysia by then . __eou__

But I can only spare you an hour and a half today , from four o'clock . __eou__ That's OK . __eou__

I'm still hungry , but I guess it's kind of rude to keep eating while he's talking , huh ? __eou__ Can you even hear what he's saying ? __eou__ No . He's so far away I can hardly see him ! Let's keep eating ! __eou__ Can you turn the lazy Susan for me ? I want some more chicken . __eou__ All that's left is a leg . I gave the head to Tim ! __eou__
Can I help you ? __eou__ I'm looking for someone who works here , but I lost his business card . His name's Long or Sang or something like that . __eou__ Chang ? __eou__ Yeah , that sounds right . __eou__ There are about twenty people named Chang who work here . What department ? __eou__ Let me think ... accounting , finance , something like that . __eou__ Eric Chang in accounting ? __eou__ That's him ! __eou__ I'll call him and tell him you're here . __eou__ I appreciate your help . __eou__ Would you like to have a seat over there ? It'll just be a minute . And can I have your name ? __eou__ Here's my card . __eou__ OK . I'll have him come up to get you . __eou__
Good morning . Could I speak to Frans Smith please ? __eou__ Frans Smith ? I think you may have the wrong number . __eou__ Is this Taiwan 8234342 2 , DS engineering ? __eou__ It is . But there is no Frans Smith here . Do you know which department he works in ? __eou__ The accounts department , I think . __eou__ The accounts department , no problem . I'm just putting you through now . __eou__
Look ! They're going to do the first drawing ! It's for a DVD player ! __eou__ Hmm . That must be the DVD player that another one of my friends donated . He owns one of the largest electronics stores in Taipei ! __eou__ They're picking a name ... It's ... Darryl from marketing ! Rats ! __eou__ Don't worry ! There are a lot more prizes ! I know , because the prizes are all from companies that I work with ! __eou__ Hmm ... Darryl doesn't look like the red underwear type ... __eou__
Our supervisor Lester does . Actually , Lester is kind of like the kitchen god . __eou__ The kitchen god ? What does he do ? __eou__ He just stays in the kitchen and watches you . Before the Chinese New Year , the kitchen god tells his boss whether you were good or bad this year . Just like Lester does ! __eou__ Oh , no ! I did a lot of bad things this year . I hope the kitchen god isn't like Lester--he blabs my mistakes to everybody ! __eou__ Actually , there's a way to keep the kitchen god from telling the bad things you did . __eou__ What is it ? Tell me ! Will it work for Lester , too ? __eou__ I think so ! Just serve a lot of sweet dishes next week . That will make the kitchen god say sweet things about you ! __eou__ Hmm . Are you sure that will work ? I already tried giving chocolate to Lester . __eou__ And what happened ? __eou__ His face broke out and he said it was my fault ! __eou__
See how many people are here ! __eou__ Yeah ! Do all these people work in the company ? Everyone and their dog is here ! __eou__ Other than the employees , our boss Jack invited some friends of the company . __eou__ Can we just sit wherever we want ? __eou__ Of course not ! We have to sit at our assigned seats . I think our table is over there in the back . __eou__ Hmm . We don't exactly have the best seats in the house , do we ? __eou__ Look who you get to sit next to--Tim from purchasing ! __eou__ Www ! That weirdo ? ! He really gives me the creeps ! __eou__ Don't worry . I'm also sitting next to you . __eou__ I just hope he doesn't start bragging again ! __eou__ I can't wait until we get our year-end bonus ! __eou__ Me , either ! Who decides how much money we get ? __eou__
Good afternoon . I'd like to speak with Tom Smith . __eou__ I'm afraid he's away from his desk at the moment . __eou__ Do you know when he will be back ? __eou__ He's away on a business trip . He won't be back until some time next week . __eou__ Is there some way I can get into contact with him ? __eou__ The best way to reach him is by cell phone . I'll give you his number . __eou__ Thanks . And could I have his e-mail , just in case I can't get him by phone ? __eou__ Sure . His cell phone is 09112223 33 . And his e-mail is lower case t , smith--that's one word , at , c , c , w , dot , com , dot , t , w . __eou__ Thank you so much . Does he read his e-mails daily ? __eou__ Yes . He usually replies immediately . __eou__ Great . Thanks again . You've been very helpful . __eou__ My pleasure . I hope you get a hold of him . __eou__
OK . Here's the final drawing ! It's for the trip ! __eou__ And the winner is ... Vivian , again ! I don't believe it ! __eou__ Our red underwear didn't do any good at all ! __eou__ Well , there are still some consolation prizes . We can go up to the front and pick them up . __eou__ So , what did you win ? __eou__ A lousy desk lamp . And you ? __eou__ A bar of soap ! __eou__ Look at Vivian ! She thinks she's the cat's meow ! __eou__ Why don't you go talk to her and find out what her secret was this year . __eou__
This'd better be good . I'm about to fire you all and find another company . __eou__ We've brought you a little something from the place down the street , Kitty Cafe-Jamaican Blue Mountain coffee beans ! __eou__ Mmm , smells good . Sure better than my instant . But please don't tell me this is another coffee-themed pitch . I thought I told you ... __eou__ ... yes , but this one has an all-new buzz . __eou__
Melanie , can you help me with something ? We need to finalize the account with the Mexican Embassy and , I need some advice on phrasing this letter correctly in English . __eou__ Sure Tracy , let me just get my laptop . __eou__ Okay , so ... To Whom It May Concern , I am writing . __eou__ Um , Tracy ? I think that ' s a little too formal . I know you want to be polite but you've already made contact with them , so in English you can be more relaxed in the opening ... __eou__ Okay , more relaxed . Got it . Hey , Sally , what ' s up ? It's Tracy here , just . __eou__ Okay Tracy , now it's too relaxed ! You've still got to show some respect . How about starting with " Dear Ms . Cooper , I'm writing to confirm ... ? __eou__ Great , okay . " Dear Miss Cooper , I'm writing to confirm the final quotation for the full page back cover color advertisement you requested for the spring issue of Voila magazine " . __eou__ That's great ... __eou__ " The final costing , including advert design and production , comes to forty-five thousand six hundred RIB . We want payment ten working days before publication or we will cancel the ad . Thanks for ... " __eou__ Woo , okay , back up a second , Tracy . That's too direct . Can I suggest you say , please note that final payment is due two working weeks before publication ? You don't want to offend her . __eou__ Oops , okay . You are right . Then I can just end with " All the best , Tracy " . __eou__ Mmmm , maybe , but I'd play it safe and just finish with " Yours Sincerely " . That's more professional . __eou__ Oh , Melanie , you are a life saver , thank you ! __eou__
Mr . Drake , I'm pleased to do business with your company . __eou__ We're glad to be able to offer our services to your business , Mrs . Wayne . __eou__ Your company is very well respected . About how long have you been in business ? __eou__ Almost twenty years . We were the first total PR services company of our kind in California . __eou__ And this is your company's head office ? __eou__ Well , yes , but now we have six offices in California alone . __eou__ That's wonderful . Isn't your company part of ARE Corporation ? __eou__ That's right . We are their sole PR sector business . __eou__ That's not bad . How long have you been in PR ? __eou__ Not long actually . So I'm sure I will learn a lot from our cooperation . __eou__
These three hours chatting with you have been very ... interesting . Could you please tell us why we're here ? __eou__ I want a new brand image . Something creative , something strong . Make no mistake , something with ... resolve ! __eou__ What is our time frame ? __eou__ Let's meet on Friday to discuss your progress . Give me your e-mail address ... umm , I mean addresses ... We'll be in touch . __eou__
Did you get Bean's ten different good luck forwards , like that one from the Dalai Lama ? __eou__ Yeah , I deleted all that superstitious crap . What a waste of bandwidth ! __eou__ I figured I might as well send one or two of them out . Maybe my luck will get better . __eou__ Do you really think the Dalai Lama sent that ? I'm tired of all these forwards . __eou__ It's worth a shot . Maybe we'll get some luck in thinking up something for this case . __eou__
I've just got Bean's new brand image . Let's make a T-shirt line with these pics . __eou__ Are you nuts ? It's the President of the United States in lingerie ! __eou__ Exactly ! With the war in Iraq , they'll sell like crazy around the world . __eou__ What's next ? Tony Blair in high heels ? __eou__ Sure . I'd rather show Bean in a garter belt , but all in good time . __eou__ Inspiration can come in the strangest ways ... __eou__
Could you tell me a little about the organization ? For example , how big is your workforce here ? __eou__ Well in total we have around 150 employees based in Hong Kong with another 400 in our head office in Beijing . The news desk staff in Hong Kong comprises around 80 staff . __eou__ I see . And how about the working hours ? __eou__ Well , as you know Rebecca , in journalism work hours are not exactly nine to five . You could be on call at any time . We do have to work very unsociable hours at times . __eou__ Well I am used to that , Mr . Parsons , so that ’ s not really a shock for me . __eou__ Good , as long as you understand that . __eou__ And when do you need to fill the vacancy , Mr . Parsons ? __eou__ Yesterday ! But no , we are hoping to start from the beginning of next month . __eou__ That sounds ideal . __eou__
Well Rebecca , is there anything else you need to know for now ? __eou__ I don ’ t think so , Mr . Parsons . I think you have covered all the main points for me . __eou__ Okay well listen , here is my business card with my mobile number . If any other questions spring to mind don ’ t hesitate to contact me . Of course you can also call Miss Childs too . __eou__ Great . Rmm , when can I expect to hear from you ? __eou__ Well , we are finishing the shortlist interviews tomorrow , so we will certainly have a decision made by early next week . Miss Childs will call you to discuss more on Monday or Tuesday . How does that sound ? __eou__ That sounds perfect . Thank you very much for taking the time to speak to me Mr . Parsons . __eou__ The pleasure ’ s all mine , Rebecca . __eou__ I hope to hear from you very soon . __eou__ Absolutely . Thanks for coming Rebecca . Goodbye . __eou__
Okay , well I ’ m sure you have a number of questions to ask me regarding the position . __eou__ Yes , well Miss Childs did give mean overview of the position over the phone , but there were some details I ’ d like to clarify . __eou__ Well feel free to ask me anything , and I ’ ll try to fill in the details . __eou__ Could I first ask about the remuneration package ? __eou__ Yes , of course . That ’ s quite an important point , isn ’ t it ? As a junior sub editor we offer a starting salary of 150,000 HK dollars per annum . This doesn ’ t include a generous housing allowance also . __eou__ I understand . And are there other bonuses included ? __eou__ Well , apart from full health insurance we do offer a company staff bonus scheme linked to readership numbers . But we could go through all the details of that at a later date . __eou__ Well , Mr . Parsons , I am flexible when it comes to salary . The opportunity to work in Hong Kong for you is the most important thing for me . __eou__ Excellent . Well , what other questions do you have Rebecca ? __eou__
Okay Rebecca , well I think you ’ Ve given me a clear impression of your positive qualities , but let ’ s talk a little bit about your weaknesses . __eou__ Okay , well it ’ s always more difficult to describe them isn ’ t it ? __eou__ Definitely , but if you had to pinpoint one weakness what would it be ? __eou__ Well as I mentioned before , I do tend to get frustrated if I don ’ t see progress in my work or career . I suppose I ’ m quite a restless character . My father always taught me to be a high achiever . __eou__ So would you say if things don ’ t go your way at work it could easily get you down ? __eou__ Well , in a way yes . But I must say that even if I ’ m not completely happy in my work I always give 110 % I would never shirk my responsibilities . I suppose sometimes I expect too much too soon . __eou__ Well , you know journalism is a highly competitive world , so you do need to keep pushing yourself it ’ s true . Okay , well let ’ s move on to talk about the job position here , shall we ? __eou__ Yes , please . __eou__
Hi Isabel ! You wanted to see me ? __eou__ Yes Anthony , come on in . Have a seat . __eou__ Is everything okay ? You seem a bit preoccupied . __eou__ Well , Anthony , this is not going to be an easy conversation.The company has made some decisions which will have a direct impact on your employment . __eou__ Okay ... __eou__ I don ’ t want to beat around the bush so I ’ m just gonna come out with it . We are going to have to let you go . __eou__ What ? Why ? I mean ... just like that ? I ’ m fired ? __eou__ I ’ m sorry but , to be honest , you are a terrible employee ! __eou__ What ! I resent that ! __eou__ Anthony , you were caught making international calls from the office phone , you called in sick in eight times this month and you smell like alcohol ! __eou__
And so , that concludes my outline for our marketing strategy next year . Thank you very much for your time . __eou__ Hey , that was quite the presentation ! Honestly , I was completely blown away by your strategy outline . I've gotta say , Alex , you really wowed me today . __eou__ Aw , come on ; it was nothing . I'm just doing my job . __eou__ No , I think you deserve some recognition here ; I mean , if I look back on your previous presentations , this is a huge improvement . __eou__ Well , Kristin did give me a hand with the slides.She ' s a real wiz on PowerPoint . __eou__ And I saw that you took on board my feedback about pricing strategies . I really appreciate you taking the time to think though my suggestions . __eou__ Yeah , well , that was some good advice . You made some really good points . __eou__ Well , I just wanted to say well done . Really you did a great job . __eou__
Good afternoon . May I help you ? __eou__ Yes , I ’ m here to see Joanna Stevens . I have an appointment at four . __eou__ Certainly , may I take your name ? I ’ ll let her know you ’ Ve arrived . __eou__ Sure , it ’ s Josh O ’ Neil . __eou__ Ms . Stevens will be with you momentarily . Can I offer you something to drink ? __eou__ Yes , a coffee would be nice , thank you . __eou__ Here you are . Ms . Stevens is ready for you now . I ’ ll show you to her office , right this way . __eou__
So , Lauren , I just wanted to talk to you quickly about our new customer support representative , Jason Huntley . __eou__ Sure , what ’ s up ? __eou__ Basically , I ’ Ve got a few concerns about him , and the bottom line is , I don ’ t think he ’ s a good fit for our company . __eou__ Okay ... what makes you say that ? I thought you were pleased with his overall performance . Didn ’ t you just tell me last week how impressed you were with his attitude ? __eou__ Yeah , his attitude is great , but he ’ s really unreliable . Sometimes he ’ s really productive , but then other times ... take last Tuesday for instance , he was forty-five minutes late for our morning meeting ! __eou__ Well , I ’ m sure he had a perfectly good reason ... __eou__ But that ’ s not the only thing ... you know , he really doesn ’ t have the best work ethic , I ’ m constantly catching him on MSN and Facebook when he should be talking to clients . __eou__ Yeah , but come on , Geoff , as if you don ’ t check Facebook at work . Look , you hired this guy , we ’ Ve invested a lot of time and money in his training , so now it ’ s up to you to coach him . Make it work , Geoff ! __eou__
Mr . McKenna , do you have a second ? I need to talk to you about something . __eou__ Sure , Liv , what can I do for you ? __eou__ Well , I was just wondering . . . you see , I know I ’ Ve used up all my vacation days this year , but my sister is getting married , and the wedding is overseas , and , well . . . __eou__ You wanna take some time off , is that right ? __eou__ Well , sir , I was just hoping that I might be able to take some unpaid leave this year . __eou__ What dates are you planning on taking off ? I ’ ll need at least two months notice , so that I can plan for your absence . __eou__ I was thinking of taking off from September first until the thirtieth . Would you be okay with that ? __eou__ Well , I guess so . __eou__
So , Casey , how are things going with the photos for the press kit ? __eou__ Yeah , I ’ Ve been meaning to talk to you about that . I might need to ask for an extension on that deadline . __eou__ You ’ Ve had over a month to get this finalized ! Why are things delayed ? __eou__ Well , the thing is , we ran into a lot of problems . . . __eou__ I ’ m not looking for excuses here . I just want to get this finished on time ! __eou__ I know , and I apologize for the delay . But some things were just beyond my control . I had trouble booking the photographer , and then Michael was sick for three weeks , so I couldn ’ t include him in the photos , and the design team lost all the files , so I had to re-do the pictures . __eou__ I ’ m not going to put this off any longer , Casey ! I want those photos ASAP ! __eou__
Hello , Fairbrook Consulting , how may I help you ? __eou__ Yes , this is Julianne Horton , and I ’ m calling to arrange an appointment with Ms . McNeal . __eou__ Certainly , what day were you thinking of ? __eou__ How ’ s Thursday ? Does she have any time available then ? __eou__ Um . . . let me double check . . . unfortunately , she ’ s booked solid on Thursday , how does next Monday work for you ? __eou__ Actually , I ’ Ve got something scheduled on Monday . Can she do Tuesday ? __eou__ Sure , Tuesday ’ s perfect . May I ask where you ’ re calling from ? __eou__ Sure , Merton Financial Advisors . __eou__ Oh , actually , Tuesday ’ s no good . Sorry about that . __eou__
Oh great ! This stupid computer froze again ! That's the third time today ! Hey Samuel , can you come take a look at my PC ? It's acting again . It must have a virus or something . __eou__ Just give me a second . I'll be right up . I ran a virus scan on your computer , and it turns out that you have a lot of infected files ! __eou__ But I'm quite careful when I'm browsing theinternet , I have no idea how I could have picked up a virus . __eou__ Well , you have to make sure that your anti-virus software is updated regularly , yours wasn't up to date , that ’ s probably what was causing your problems . __eou__ Ok . Anything else ? __eou__ Yeah , try not to kick or hit the computer ! __eou__ Um yeah . Sorry about that . __eou__
I've run out of steam . To be honest , I want to be in a different environment . __eou__ Is that so ? __eou__ Yes . I don't want to be stuck in a rut . I want to move on . __eou__ Have you decided ? __eou__ Yes , I want to get a better job . __eou__ Could you tell me why you want to quit ? __eou__ I'm quitting because of the lousy salary and all the difficulties I have in getting along with my colleagues . __eou__ Oh , that sounds terrible . Would you be happier with higher pay here ? I " m sure something can be worked out . __eou__ I'm afraid not . I've promised my girlfriend . We're going to travel south to find jobs that offer higher pay . __eou__ OK . I'd like to say that I've really enjoyed working with you . However , I think you should work harder at your new job and then you can ask for higher pay . __eou__
Is it all right for me to come in now . Mr . Sutcliffe ? __eou__ Well ... I'm pretty busy . but ... all right . come in . What can I do for you ? __eou__ Do you mind if I sit down ? __eou__ Not at all . Take a seat . Now , what can I do for you ? __eou__ I want to leave the department . Do you think I could put in for a transfer ? __eou__ Yes , but why should you want to do that ? __eou__ Do you mind if I speak frankly ? __eou__ Not at all . Go ahead . __eou__ Well , you see . I don't like the office . I don't like the staff and I'm afraid you and I don't get on . So may I put in for a transfer ? __eou__ Yes . I'd delighted if you did . __eou__
John , could you come to my office ? I need to talk to you . __eou__ Sure . I'll be there as soon as I finish this document . __eou__ No . Come here right now . __eou__ OK . __eou__ What's the matter ? __eou__ I'm sorry to say that we have to let you go , John . __eou__ Why ? I work very hard . __eou__ Well , you're working very hard but not efficiently . And you don't work well with other employees . __eou__ Well , some of those other guys are not the same kind I'd like to communicate with , but if that's important to you . I'll try to get along with them . __eou__ I'm afraid it's too late . We are downsizing our workforce and you'll have to go . __eou__ It's unfair . __eou__ We can give you the option of residing rather than being fired , because it will look better on your resume when you apply for another job if you resign . __eou__ OK . I need to think about that for a while . __eou__ All right , but let me know your decision before the end of the day . __eou__
How do you like your job here , Linda ? __eou__ It's interesting , I like being an editor . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ I like talking to writers , I get to meet a lot of interesting people . __eou__ I'm happy to hear that , but publishing is more than just talking to writers . it involves a lot of work , patience and responsibility . Most of the work is boring . __eou__ I don't feel bored at all . I'm getting along with my colleagues . I will enjoy working with them . People are great in this industry . __eou__ Do you have any complaints ? __eou__ No , I have no complaints . I hear there are many opportunities to move up in this company . is that true ? __eou__ Yes , you have many opportunities to grow in this company as long as you do well . __eou__ That's perfect . I will definitely do well . __eou__
I can't stand the stupid guy any longer . It ' s unbelievable ! __eou__ Oh , my dear lady . Take it easy . You should forgive a green hand like him . __eou__ He does everything so mindlessly that he is going to drive me crazy . __eou__ I suggest you talk with him and teach him how to deal with the problems . __eou__ I have told him how to do it several times , but he's never listened to me . __eou__ Maybe you should communicate with him just like a friend and not a boss . __eou__ Oh , I always have difficulty in getting along with the staff . __eou__ Just take them for your good friends and have a talk with them as we do , make sure you don't lose your temper . __eou__ I think that's a bad idea . I'd hate anyone here to think of me as a friend . How would they ever respect me as they can do whatever they want ? __eou__ I disagree . All you have to do is respect the staff and their opinions . __eou__
If we are to modernize our information processing , manufacturing system and management code , we need to complete our office automation . __eou__ Yes , you're right . We have to equip our company with a network of workstations at every office as soon as possible . __eou__ Our copying machines are too slow , our telephone system is limited in function , and our offices are not well-equipped for us to work efficiently . To improve the offices for higher efficiency , we have to change all the chairs and some of the desks also , redesign our office so that we may have more space . __eou__ Good . We can contact the Tiana Office Furniture Store , and ask them to install computers in our company , deliver new tables and other furniture to match the function of the computers , and to improve our work atmosphere simultaneously . __eou__
May I come in ? __eou__ Come in , please . __eou__ I'm sorry to trouble you , but I'd like to ask when I will get a raise . __eou__ In 3 months or so . __eou__ You said the same thing three months ago . __eou__ Did I ? Well , anyway , you will get your raise when the economy starts picking up . __eou__ You mean that I won't get a raise until the recession ends ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ I got the message . I'm quiting . __eou__ Nah , don't be so fast . We like your work here , but this company is on hard times and I can't be handing out raises for anyone . __eou__ I've been here for 3 years , and I haven't had a raise in all that time . If you like my work , it should be reflected in my pay , and I feel it isn't . __eou__ I hear what you're saying , and I wish there were something I could do . __eou__ Very well , consider me gone . __eou__
Mr . Black , I ' d like to take some time off . I ' Ve been feeling exhausted these days . __eou__ That's no problem . Let me see ... You still have ten days annual leave left , is that right ? __eou__ Yes . I was wondering if I could take another two weeks off . __eou__ That's long leave . How's your project coming along ? __eou__ The project I'm in charged of now will be done by the end of this week . I'd like to take my leave from next Monday on . __eou__ Well , all right . But you make sure to tie up loose ends before you leave . __eou__ Thank you , Mr.Black . There are no immediate projects coming up at the moment . Mr.Smith will be in charge during my absence . He is taking part in several projects as my assistant and knows how to maintain relationships with our clients . __eou__ Great ! I hope you have a good relaxation and come back refreshed . __eou__ I will . Many thanks , Mr.Black . __eou__
You'v been work here for nearly a month , how do you feel about the job ? __eou__ Not bad . Thank you for your help . I am always busy with this job , I feel a bit tired . __eou__ I had the same feeling when I first came to work here . but after a period of time , I feel better , I am sure you ' ll get used to this busy job . __eou__ I also feel that work efficiency here is very high . and you have strong working ability and professional skill , it seems that you know all , that's really wonderful ! __eou__ You know the phrase the survival of the fittest . We have no choices . __eou__ That's right , I have to work . __eou__
How do you do ? __eou__ How do you do ? __eou__ My name is Wang Liang , I ’ m from Beijing . Where do you come from ? __eou__ I come from the city of Tangshan in Hebes Province . __eou__ You're from Tangshan ? I can't believe my ears . I was also born in Tangshan , but I was brought up in Beijing . __eou__ Really ? It's nice to meet you . How long have you been with this company ? __eou__ Just over 4 years now . Since this is your first day here , I'm sure you don't really know too much yet . Let me show you around , so you can introduce yourself to everyone . __eou__ Oh , Thank you very much ! __eou__

Is it a new brand ? __eou__ Yes , we just got it and it is fabulous .

Then you need to send the file . Make sure you choose the right printer . We have a few here and you're hooked up to all of them . __eou__ Which one is this ? __eou__ It's the Canon . __eou__
Good morning , I ’ m Daniel . I ’ m applying for the positon of manager . __eou__ Yes . Sit down , please . How did you learn about our company ? __eou__ I got to know your company through such famous brands as LUX , LIPTON and WALLS .

And your company is the best-known . Although I don ’ t have much experience as a manager , the job description you sent to me was very interesting .

Okay , now I ’ d like to find out more about your last job . I see you spent almost four years at the London Weekly , is that right ? __eou__ Yes , that ’ s right . To be honest , the first year was quite tough for me . I was really just treated more like an intern . I didn ’ t have many responsibilities and I found it quite frustrating . __eou__ So , what changed ? __eou__ Well slowly but surely I proved myself , and the new editor liked me so he promoted me to features writer . __eou__ Wow , a real step up ! __eou__ Yes , I was responsible for restaurant and food reviews mostly . I spent restaurant years in that position , but to be honest it wasn ’ t an area of journalism I wanted to stay in long-term . __eou__ I see , so why did you decide to leave finally ? __eou__ I just felt that the paper couldn ’ t offer me any new opportunities . I really needed a more challenging role to be honest . __eou__
Now , if I look here I see that you completed a BA in English ? __eou__ Yes , that ’ s right . After graduating from high school in New York I attended York University in the UK . My major was English , and my minor was business studies . I completed my BA in 2004 . __eou__ Yes , I ’ m pleased to see that you also got a distinction . __eou__ Yes that ’ s right .

And after your internship ? __eou__ They seemed impressed , and offered me a position as a junior local news reporter . I ended up staying two years there actually . I was in charge of the sports news section of the newspaper . I really enjoyed it there , and it really helped me build my skills . __eou__ Yes I see .

My Father was in the oil business before he retired so we also spent a number of years in Saudi Arabia too . __eou__ Very interesting . So it seems you had quite an adventurous childhood . __eou__ Absolutely ! We were never still for too long . But now I ’ m really looking to settle down . __eou__ I see . okay , well let ’ s move on to discuss your education shall we ? __eou__

How could we advertise our celebrations to mark the centenary of the founding of the university ? __eou__ I ’ m sure we could get one or two tv companies to come in . Perhaps the president could invite them and do an interview . __eou__ That ’ s a good idea . We could put up some posters in and around the campus with a list of events . It would be quite cheap to do on the campus . __eou__ It will be expensive to do outside the campus . Perhaps we could arrange for some sponsorship . __eou__ We could contact alumni who work for large , well-know companies . They might be able to arrange cheap advertising in exchange for some free tickets . __eou__ Good thinking ! We should also print some leaflets for students to distribute . __eou__ We should put some information about it on the home page of our university website . When people visit the website , they ’ ll see the information . __eou__ We could take out some advertisements to local newspapers . I checked the prices and they are reasonable . __eou__ Ok . Let ’ s get to work on our advertising campaign . __eou__

Our course will end soon . __eou__ Yes . I ’ Ve sent letters to several banks . A few have invited me for interviews after we take our examinations . __eou__ Well done ! I haven ’ t sent off any job applications yet . __eou__ Which field would you like to work in ? have you decide yet ? __eou__ I ’ d like to work in marketing . I think I could have a good career in that field . __eou__ Perhaps you should apply to banks as well . They need people to market their service . As you said , the banking industry pays well . __eou__ That ’ s great idea . Do you have the email address of human resource managers at any banks ? __eou__
We ’ re having a department meeting at 10 o ’ clock , ok ? __eou__ That ’ s fine ...

What if I can ’ t get a hold of them by phone ? __eou__ Then , you should e-mail them with the information . __eou__ Where can I find their e-mail addresses ? __eou__ They should have then listed on their resumes . __eou__ And if there aren ’ t any e-mail addresses ? __eou__ Then send them a SMS on their cell phone . __eou__ Ok . That sounds easy enough . Have you called any of them yet ? __eou__ Yes . I called the first three people on the list , but they didn ’ t pick up . __eou__ Did you leave a voice message ? __eou__ I left a voice message on one---just for the first person on the list . __eou__ I see . What did you tell her ? __eou__ I told her that she should call me back at my office number . __eou__ Ok , so , maybe I should call her again . __eou__ Yes , that sounds like a good idea . She might not get the other message in time . __eou__ One more question . It looks like some of these numbers are long-distance . Do you have a calling card that I can use to get through to them ? __eou__ Sure . You can use this one . The pin number is written on the back of the card . __eou__ Alright . Thanks a lot .

Mr . Bryant ? Hi , I'm Mike from Florence Incorporated . I'll glad you made it okay . How was your flight ? __eou__ It was pretty bumpy , also a bit long , all together about 5 hours . __eou__ That is a long flight . You had a layover too , is that right ?

Hello , Mr.Benson , welcome to Beijing ! Is this your first time to visit china ? __eou__ Oh , no , I'v already made several trips to Guangzhou , this is my first trip to Beijing though.It is a lot larger than I expected it would be . __eou__ Yes , Beijing has been grown over the last few years , there are a lot of improvements and changes being made for the Olympics . What would you like to see changing be made for Olympic , what would you like to see when are you here ? __eou__ I hope to have time to visit great wall when I am here , I always want to go there , I think it would be a real shame by came all the way in Beijing and didn't make out the wall , do you think I have a chance to see it ? __eou__ I can pretty sure it can be arranged , the wall is a short distance from the city , but we could make arrangements for driver to take us out to visit the great wall during when our afternoon breaks , I also recommend you to visit Tian'an Men Square and city while you add it ! __eou__ Yes , that would be nice , would I have a tour guide to tour completely visit these places ? __eou__ Don't worry , I would be able to go along with you , over the next few days , if you have any questions or problems , I will be right here to help you out , I can be a translator and tour guide . __eou__ Thank you very much . __eou__ My pleasure , I hope your visit to Beijing is very enjoyable ! __eou__
I've been waiting here in the conference room for ten minutes already . What time does our meeting start ? Where is everyone anyway ? __eou__ Didn't you hear about that ? Our meeting was proponed until Friday . __eou__ What ? The meeting was proponed ? No one told me anything about it . __eou__ Didn't you get the memo ? __eou__ What memo ? There haven't been any memos this whole week . I check my unbox every day , and I haven't seen anything . __eou__ The memo went out three days ago . It should have made it to your in-box , but maybe it got lost in all the clutter on your desk . __eou__ You know how things get piled up on my desk when I am busy — I know that sometimes I do misplace things , but I always read all the memos that go around . They go directly to my in-box . Are you sure it was sent to the whole office ? __eou__ It should have gone around to everybody . They also posted a copy of the memo in the break-room . Don't you ever look at the messages posted on the bulletin board ? __eou__ I'm usually too busy to take a bunch of coffee breaks and gossip by the water cooler . Anyway , I am sure the memo never got to my in-box . I'll have to talk to our secretary about it . __eou__ That's right . You never know what you're missing out if you don't read the memos . __eou__
Ms.Dawson , I need you to take a dictation for me . __eou__ Yes , sir ... __eou__ This should go out as an intra-office memorandum to all employees by this afternoon.Are you ready ? __eou__ Yes , sir.Go ahead . __eou__ Attention all staff ... Effective immediately , all office communications are restricted to email correspondence and official memos.The use of Instant Message programs by employees during working hours is strictly prohibited . __eou__ Sir , does this apply to intra-office communications only ? Or will it also restrict external communications ? __eou__ It should apply to all communications , not only in this office between employees , but also any outside communications . __eou__ But sir , many employees use Instant Messaging to communicate with their clients . __eou__ They will just have to change their communication methods . I don't want any - one using Instant Messaging in this office.It wastes too much time ! Now , please continue with the memo.Where were we ? __eou__ This applies to internal and external communications . __eou__ Yes.Any employee who persists in using Instant Messaging will first receive a warning and be placed on probation.At second offense , the employee will face termination.Any questions regarding this new policy may be directed to department heads . __eou__ Is that all ? __eou__ Yes.Please get this memo typed up and distributed to all employees before 4 pm . __eou__
Office software like Windows might be one of the best inventions in this information age . It saves us from so much work and makes the communication even around the world much easier . __eou__ Fully agree . I do enjoy the convenience though I am still a beginner in using Excel . The latest office equipment is more type-functional . It combines fax machine , copy machine and printer in one . It saves a lot of place one machine instead of three . __eou__ Yes , this machine is even smaller than those before . __eou__ When will we get one of those ? __eou__ You know our boss always trying to save the last penny . We have to use up the equipment first . __eou__
Here is the document you asked for this morning . __eou__ Oh , you are so efficient . I thought you might give it to me tomorrow . Thanks . __eou__ You ’ re welcome . You know , these days I have been reflecting on my biggest weakness procrastination . The more I think about it , the more I hate myself for being so disorganized . I decided to change the situation as soon as possible . Otherwise I will be more regretful later . __eou__ This is encouraging news , good for you ! What is your solution , then ? __eou__ The most useful method is to make plans and set priorities . It helps me to manage time well and get the most important things done at the first place . __eou__ Sounds not bad ! Better performance isn ’ t just about doing a lot more . It is about focusing on the right things to do . __eou__
Hello ! You have reached the offices of Maddox and McKnight , can I help you ? __eou__ Yes , my name is Max Richards . May I please speak to George Nelson ? I have already called several times . It seems I always catch him out of the office . __eou__ Oh , I'm sorry . Mr . Nelson is away at the moment . I'm sorry that you keep missing him while he is out of the office . Would you like to leave a message ? __eou__ I'm sorry , I didn't hear you clearly . Could you repeat that please ? __eou__ Certainly . Mr . Nelson can not take your call at the moment because he is away . He stepped out of the office for the whole afternoon and is not expected back until tomorrow morning . His schedule is very unpredictable at times , so the best way to reach him is to first make an appointment by email or text messaging . __eou__ Can I leave a message for him please ? __eou__ Of course , can you leave your name and number ? I'm sure Mr . Nelson will return your call as soon as he is able . __eou__ My name is Max Richards , my phone number is 898-3423 . Could you ask him to call me back as soon as he gets back , please ? I have a rather timely matter to discuss with him . __eou__ Can you tell me what it's about ? I can make a note of it , so Mr . Nelson is aware and prepared when he returns your call . __eou__ Yes , please let him know I would like to discuss the Girard case with him . __eou__
Our productivity has been down for more than six months now . I'm seriously considering pulling in an outside consultant to diagnose the cause of our problematic areas . I think we'd all benefit from an outsider's perspective . Sometimes we're just too closed to the problems to see the forest for the trees . __eou__ I think that's a good idea . You know I got a golfing buddy that runs a consultant firm . He's an expert in organizational comunication.He does't come cheap , but he's an expert in this field.Maybe he could help get things on track . __eou__ Do you have his card ? What's in his portfolio ? Which firm has he worked for in the past ? __eou__ He's done staff for Microsoft and Boeing . I think he's been involved with Siemens ' training evaluations as well . I'll get you his card , you can give him a call . __eou__
Hello , this is Francis from XYZ Company . I would like to discuss with you about a new project some time next week . Do you have time to meet ? __eou__ Well , I am not sure .

So I will be arriving at your office around two fifteen PM . __eou__ Yes , there is . See you then . __eou__
I am going on a business trip to Guangzhou next Monday morning . __eou__ To visit our supplier ? __eou__ Yes , as the New Year is coming , they ’ re organizing a party for all their customers . __eou__ Well , I guess you will meet many people in this field . So don ’ t forget to pack enough business cards in your suitcase . __eou__ Sure . __eou__ By the way , do you know that our company just made some changes in the business trip policy ? __eou__ No , no one has informed me of that so far , tell me . __eou__ Ok , there is no cash advance anymore for short trips . You have to pay out of your own pocket , so save all the receipts from your business trip . And then attach them to your expense account . When you get back , our company will reimburse everything . __eou__ I see . What about the maximum purdy and rate , any change ? __eou__ I am not sure . You can check with the finance department . __eou__ I will call them this afternoon , thanks . __eou__ You ’ re welcome . Have a nice trip . __eou__

... Now , that's all I want to say about world coal reserves . So let's move on to the next topic , renewable resources . There are three things we have to consider when talking about renewable resources . First , sustainability ; second , marketability ; lastly , the reality factor . Let's talk about each point in more detail ... John , would you like to take it from here ? __eou__ Certainly . As my colleague just mentioned , sustainability is a major concern when examining the potential output of a resource . Of course , as you can see from the content of our presentation today , with renewable resource , there is a much larger sustainability than with non-renewable resource . __eou__
Hello . This is Lucy from ABC Company . Is this Monica ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ I am calling to inform you that you have passed the first two rounds of interview .

I will be there on time . __eou__ Ok , see you then , bye . __eou__ Bye . __eou__
So that concludes the introduction . Now let's move to the first part of my talk , which is about 2006 fiscal year marketing plan . So first , right off the bat , When looking at the marketing plan , tell me some of the goals that we had set this year to begin with ... __eou__ We wanted to appeal to a younger set of consumers and also , in line with that goal , redo our image ... __eou__ That's correct . If you remember , we also set a goal to double distribution in overseas markets . Now , when looking at the data to evaluate whether or not we made our goals , there are three things to consider . First , the original condition of the market , second , our marketing numbers from the previous year , and third , our final sales figures for this year . Now I want to describe for you the second and third parts . If you look at the overhead , you'll see a graph ... The blue line represents our sales from the year 2005 , the red line is the sales in 2006 ... As you can see , our sales in 2005 were quite slow to start off with , but managed to make decent performance in the last part of the year . On the other hand , you can see this year's sales took off like a rocket . __eou__
Good morning , ladies and gentlemen , we are happy you have all come out for our training workshop . Today we have a great line-up of speakers to talk to you . First on our program is a well-renown expert in the field of international economic development , Harvard's own Dr . James Smith . Dr . Smith has been involved in economic research for over twenty years , and has taught at Harvard since 1995 . And now , without further adieu , we'd like to welcome Mr . James Smith . __eou__ Thank you , Mr . Jackson , ladies and gentlemen , colleagues , friends . The subject of my talk is international relations in a morgen world . I plan to say a few words about the current situation in the Middle East and how it affects world economy . I'd like to give you an overview of the way that the economies of seemingly unrelated countries are intertwined . I've divided my talk into three parts , first an overview of international relations , second a discussion of current political situations , and lastly trends for the future . My presentation will take about two hours , but there will be a twenty-minute break in the middle . We'll stop for lunch at 12 . __eou__
Could I ask you for a favor ? My laser printer is out of ink and I need to print out something urgent . If you don ’ t mind , I would like to send you these files . Could you then print these for me ? __eou__ Sure , just send me through internal mail . __eou__ Thanks , Vivian . __eou__ No problem at all . Welcome . __eou__
Could you please cover for me two hours this morning ? __eou__ Sure . Any specific reason I should know about in case people ask where you are . __eou__ I have to see the dentist . We have an appointment for this morning from 9 to 11 o ’ clock . So if there is any phone call , please pick up for me . If there is something urgent , tell them I will be back in two hours . __eou__ No problem . Good luck . __eou__ Yes , I will need it . Thanks . __eou__
Hi , Monica , I am afraid I can ’ t make it to the office to punch out . __eou__ Where are you ? __eou__ I am still in XYZ Company , this meeting took longer than I expected . Say to it that the office manager knows I won ’ t be in to punch my card . __eou__ Ok . __eou__
I would like to ask for one day off next week . Do you think the manager will agree ? I know it is the busy time for our company , but I do have some important things to handle . __eou__ Well , it is hard to say . At least you need to come up with a good reason . __eou__ Actually , it is my mother ’ s wedding . My parents divorced many years ago . Now she is ready to establish a new family . It is a special occasion . I ’ Ve got to be there , right ? __eou__ Yes , you should be there . Go find the manager and ask . I think the manager will understand and approve you a day off . Don ’ t forget to fill in the leave application form . It will be signed by the manager for approval . __eou__ Thank you so much . __eou__
Can I ask for leave this afternoon ? __eou__ What is the problem ? __eou__ I had a headache this morning . I didn ’ t pay attention to it . I thought probably it is because I didn ’ t sleep well . But now it is getting worse and worse . I feel quite dizzy now and my eyes are somehow very light-sensitive . Maybe it is the migrated . __eou__ It is ok . You look really pale and red eyes . I suggest you go home immediately and have a good rest . __eou__ Thank you very much . I am sure good rest will do indeed . I don ’ t have this too often . __eou__
Listen , you can not afford another day off . You ’ Ve called in sick five times in the last three weeks . __eou__ I know , but I am really sick . __eou__ Well . I want a note from the doctor this one and to be honest , if it continues , we may not be able to have you here . __eou__ I understand , sir . I ’ ll bring a doctor ’ s note in tomorrow . I am sorry , Mr . Thomas __eou__
My computer isn ’ t running at the same speed it used to be , it is testing my patience everyday . Can you tell me how to make it run faster ? __eou__ If you want to speed up your system , you ’ Ve got to clean it up first . __eou__ How ? __eou__ You need to free your disk space . The simplest way is to use a Disk-Cleanup tool to remove temporary files and in store programs that you no longer use . Things should be fine next time you start . You also need to control what starts up . There is a program calls Start-up Delayer , It can help to set after how much time programs should be loaded after Windows boosts . For example , you can choose to set your Fox Mail program to load 30 seconds after Windows starts up . __eou__ Very useful advice , I will try them right now . __eou__
Francis , you have done an outstanding work in the past six months . In view of your achievement , I trust you ’ re now indispensable part of our company and you deserve an officer director title . __eou__ I am so happy to know that I could make some contribution to our company . __eou__ This title does not only give you a raising pay-check , but also increase responsibilities . Congratulations , and hope the best for you . __eou__ Thank you , I will be doing my best . __eou__
Hi , Monica , how is everything going ? __eou__ Everything goes well , but I am thinking about quitting my current job . __eou__ Why ? You ’ re not satisfied anymore ? __eou__ I just sense . But I cannot grow anymore . My boss is not really supporting me . I am interested in some positions in other JV companies , but I need to do some more in-step research before I send my application letters out . __eou__ That is important . Doing research on a company you are interested in will definitely help your application . __eou__ Certainly , it is very nice talking with you . But I really have to go now . Catch you later . __eou__ Ok , good luck to you . __eou__
Congratulations , Francis . Your hard working finally pays off . I am so happy for your promotion . __eou__ Thanks , Monica . Without support from you and other colleagues , I would not have made it . __eou__ I hope I could get promoted some day . Tell me about your experience , ok ? __eou__ Well , just saying that you wanted to get promoted is not enough , you need to write down your desirable position and an available plan for achieving that adjective . Don ’ t be afraid of taking challenging . They might be opportunities and failing is not fatal . You learn more from that actually . Sometimes , you need to fail to be successful . __eou__ How do you think if I volunteer for some work ? __eou__ I think it is a smart idea . Our boss always likes it when employees take initiatives . __eou__
Marketing Manager ’ s Office . Can I help you ? __eou__ Mr . Smith , please . __eou__ Sorry , he is out . __eou__ What time do you expect him back then ? __eou__ Sorry , I am not sure . Can I take a message ? __eou__ No , thanks . I will call back later . __eou__ That ’ s fine . Please call again later . __eou__ OK . Thank you . Goodbye . __eou__
When can I have your firm C . I . F . prices , that is to say , the final offer , Mr . London ? __eou__ We ’ ll have them worked out by this evening and let you have them tomorrow morning . Would you be free to come by then ? __eou__ Yes . I ’ ll be here tomorrow morning at 10 . __eou__ Perfect . Our offer remains open for 3 days . __eou__ I don ’ t need that long to make up my mind . If your prices are agreeable and if I can get the commission I want , I can place the order right away . __eou__ I ’ m sure you ’ ll find our price most favorable . Elsewhere prices for hardware have gone up tremendously in recent years . Our prices haven ’ t changed much . __eou__ I ’ m glad to hear that . As I ’ Ve just said , I hope to conclude some substantial business with you . __eou__ We shall be very pleased . Is there anything else I can do for you , Mrs . Anderson ? __eou__ I ’ m buying for chain department stores in Canada . They are also interested in Egyptian carpets . Could you introduce me to the person in charge of this line ? __eou__ Certainly , I ’ ll make an appointment for you with Mr . Jordan of the Egypt National Native Produce and Animal By-products Import and Export Corporation . __eou__ Thank you very much . __eou__
If you are staying here for a few days , we ’ d be delighted to see you at our factory . __eou__ It ’ s very kind of you to say so . My associate and I will be interested in visiting your factory . __eou__ Let us know when you are free . We ’ ll arrange the tour for you . __eou__ Thank you . I ’ ll give you a call this afternoon to set the time . There ’ s nothing like seeing things with one ’ s own eyes . __eou__ That ’ s for sure . You ’ ll know our products better after the visit . __eou__
We did a survey on your job performance . __eou__ How did I do ? __eou__ Not so good . Lots of complains . __eou__ Really ? I thought I was doing well . __eou__ Your performance so far is not quite in line with what we expect for our executives . I hope I ’ Ve made my point . __eou__
I ’ ll show you around and explain the operation as we go along . __eou__ That ’ ll be most helpful . __eou__ That is our office block . We have all the administrative depart - ments there . Down there is the research and development section . __eou__ How much do you spend on development every year ? __eou__ About 3-4 % of the gross sales . __eou__ What ’ s that building opposite us ? __eou__ That ’ s the warehouse . We keep a stock of the faster moving items so that urgent orders can be met quickly from stock . __eou__ If I placed an order now , how long would it be before I got delivery ? __eou__ It would largely depend on the size of the order and the items you want . __eou__
How do you think the report I wrote ? __eou__ Not bad . But there is more room for improvement . __eou__ I jumped the gun . __eou__ There were some gaps in your report . Please be more sorrow . __eou__ Yes , I overlooked some facts . I ’ ll be more sorrow . __eou__
I ’ m glad to have the opportunity of visiting your corporation . I hope to conclude some substantial business with you . __eou__ It ’ s a great pleasure to meet you , Mr . Brown . I believe you have seen our exhibits in the showroom . May I know what particular items you ’ re interested in ? __eou__ I ’ m interested in your hardware . I ’ Ve seen the exhibits and studied your catalogues . I think some of the items will find a ready market in Canada . Here is a list of my requirements , for which I ’ d like to have your lowest quotations , C . I . F . Vancouver . __eou__ Thank you for your inquiry . Would you tell us the quantity you require so that we can work out the offers ? __eou__ I ’ ll do that . Meanwhile , could you give me an indication of price ? __eou__ Here are our F . O . B . price lists . All the prices in the lists are subject to our confirmation . __eou__ What about the commission ? From European suppliers I usually get a 3 to 5 percent commission for my imports . It ’ s the general practice . __eou__ As a rule we don ’ t allow any commission . But if the order is a substantial one , we ’ ll consider it . __eou__ You see , but I do business on a commission basis . A commission on your prices would make it easier for me to promote sales . Even two or three percent would help . __eou__ That ’ s something we can discuss later . __eou__
How do I submit an expense report ? __eou__ You need all your receipts for reimbursement . __eou__ You mean I have to attach the receipts with the expense report ? __eou__ Yes , here is the form for an expense report . Fill it out and give it to me . I ’ ll get it signed for you . __eou__
Good morning , Miss Monica . Nice to meet you again ! __eou__ Good morning , Mr . Thomas , it is nice to see you too . __eou__ After the internal discussion , we have all agreed that you are the most suitable person for this position among all the candidates . So , today let ’ s talk about your expected salary and social benefits . What is your expected salary ? __eou__ I ’ Ve worked in the field for more than 4 years . Depend on my work qualifications and experience , I would like to have 5000 Yuan to start . __eou__ The basic salary for this position in our company would be 4800 Yuan to start with increases giving according to your performance . __eou__ It is a bit lower than I expected . But I can accept that . What are the working hours ? __eou__ 40 hours a week , Monday to Friday , 9 AM to 5 PM with one hour lunch break every day .. __eou__ Do I have to work on weekend ? If so , how do you pay for the overtime ? __eou__ We do expect overtime work when it is necessary , but we pay twice of the work hour for working on weekends and three times for working on national holidays like Spring Festival and the Mid-Autumn Day . __eou__ Is there probation ? __eou__ No probation is involved . If you feel good , you can start next week . __eou__
Hello , Mr . Thomas . Could you spare a minute ? __eou__ What do you need ? __eou__ I need to talk to you about that new driver you ’ Ve hired . I think I am going to have some problems working with him . __eou__ He seems to be quite qualified . If it is a personal problem I preferred if you would work out between yourselves . __eou__
Could you give me an expense report ? I would like to attach the invoices for my phone bill this season . __eou__ Here you are . Do you need glue ? __eou__ That is very kind of you . I ’ m just running out of glue . __eou__ You ’ re welcome . __eou__
With tomorrow being Labor Day and all , I think it would be a nice gesture to let all the members of laboring staff leave work an hour early . What do you say ? __eou__ What ! That sounds perfectly ridiculous ! Labour Day is a holiday for everyone , not just laboring staff ... and we get a whole day off tomorrow anyway , so what's the point of an extra hour tonight ? __eou__ Well , we all get Labour Day off as a holiday , the real purpose of the holiday is to remember all the people who do manual or other hard labor . It's to celebrate those who work doing what other people might not be willing to do . I think we ought to do something in honor of the common worker . __eou__ So if we did allow the laboring force to go home early , how many people are we talking about ? __eou__ In our company , the loborial force makes up 60 % of our workers . We'd just be letting slightly over half the folks out a little early . __eou__
I call this meeting to order . Thank you all in attendance today , I know it's a busy day for you all . We have a lot of material to cover today . Did everyone get an agenda ? __eou__ I need a copy of the agenda . Also , may I suggest something ? I know we have many points to review today , but would it be possible to limit our meeting time to finish before four o'clock ? Many of us still have a mountain of work to do before the day's end . __eou__ We should be able to finish everything up before then . Let's run through the major points first , and see where we're at . The first matter of business is to approve the minutes of our last meeting . __eou__ I propose we accept the minutes . __eou__ Good . Do I have a second ? __eou__ I second . __eou__ motion carried . Now , next on our agenda is our budget review . Margaret , can you please fill us in on where the budget review stands ? __eou__ I gave everyone a copy of the manual last week . We've had the review board going over everything , and they have come up with a final review . Here's a copy for everyone , and if you have any questions , you can talk to me after the meeting . Basically , the budget review has been completed , with maybe a few polishing details left . __eou__ What kind of action is required ? __eou__ If everyone could take a look at the final review handout , if there're any objections or corrections , let me know . Next week , we can cast the final approval . __eou__
Could I ask some questions regarding to the social benefits ? __eou__ Go ahead , please . __eou__ How long is my paid vacation every year ? __eou__ You ’ ll have 10 days paid vacation every year . __eou__ What about the insurance and housing policies ? __eou__ We will provide you wit life insurance , health insurance , accident insurance , housing benefits , heating allowance and transportation allowance . __eou__ How often is the bonus ? __eou__ You ’ ll be paid a bonus at the end of every year . __eou__ Do I have training opportunities ? __eou__ We provide our employees with training opportunities at home and abroad . __eou__ Well , I don ’ t have any other questions so far . I would like to think a couple of days before I give you my final answer . __eou__ Sure . I will ask Lucy to call you in two days . __eou__ Ok , thank you for your time and patience . __eou__ You ’ re welcome . __eou__
Give these sales figures a look . It's pretty depressing . We're way in the red this year . We can't afford to keep going like this for much longer . __eou__ You're right , we need to start making money soon , or at least manage to break even . But I think that the market is slowly beginning to heat up--sales are bound to pick up any time now . __eou__ Deman is dropping . The problem is our competition . They are monopolizing the market ! __eou__ Maybe we should rethink our marketing strategy to include the possibility that our new line of cosmetics could be a big seller . __eou__ It's really too early to tell , but a lot is riding on the new products . If we don't do better after the product launch , we may have to go bankrupt . __eou__ Do you think it's that serious ? __eou__ Look at this numbers and see for yourself . Read'sm and weep . __eou__ My goodness , I didn't realize it was that bad . __eou__
What's our target audience for this campaign ? __eou__ This go-around we're focusing on new moms , families with median income and one or more children under the age of two . __eou__ Do you think that's much different from the succor moms we tailored the last campaign for ? __eou__ Well , there are some similarities that come up . Because both groups are made up of mothers ... so as before , we can play up on maternal instincts , hygiene , safety , along those lines . But that being said , there are some specific differences that come into play because we are dealing with mothers of infants here . __eou__ Right , that makes sense . What's the average age ? __eou__ Demographics say an average age of 28.7 , educational background of university or post-grad , annual household income of 40-50 K a year . __eou__
What kind of promotional events are scheduled for the new product line ? __eou__ Marketing has us set up with product launches in five major cities , as well as some sponsoring events throughout the year . All together , there will be 15 events . __eou__ What kind of sponsoring are we talking about ? I don't know how effective sponsorship really is ... __eou__ It's not what you're thinking . These events will give us a wider exposure than most . Take the tri-city marathon for starters . This is a highly publicized event . The television exposure alone will nearly double our customer awareness . __eou__ Other than the marathon , what else is on the list ? __eou__ We've got a spot in Olympic Stadium sponsoring one of a team's equipment , then a rally for cancer research , and a connection to the inner-city education program . __eou__ Sports , medicine , education ... seems kind of random , don't you think ? __eou__ It might seem that way , but this events were all carefully chosen based on marketing research . These are the events that our customers and potential customers care about . __eou__
How long will it take for our order to be delivered ? __eou__ Let's see ... You are importing fifty containers of textiles from China . They should be able to place your order before the end of next week . It will take 2 days for shipping to the port city of Ningpo . The freight will take 3 weeks on the open ocean , and will arrive in Los Angeles approximately a month from today . Domestic shipping will be your responsibility , you can make arrangements with the pier in Los Angeles . __eou__ Fine . We will handle domestic shipping , but what about customs ? Will we have to pay tariff on our imports ? I hope we don't run into any problems with the border control . __eou__ No , the Chinese company has that all worked out . With the paperwork you receive with the shipment , you should be good to go . __eou__
What are our areas for growth ? What sectors do you see the most potential in ? If we are going to pull our sales numbers up and develop the brand , we got to work across the board . __eou__ It's not just spreading out to new markets that we have to address . I think we'd better first pay attention to developing our brand in the markets we already have.We ' Ve reached the awareness level , but we haven't established customer loyalty . People know who we are , but they still don't trust in our brand . __eou__ I don't see why we can't work on opening new markets and developing the markets we've already penetrated at the same time ... Both aspects of developing our customer base and developing our brand are important . __eou__
Which of the steps are you focusing on in brandgrowth Awareness , understanding , acceptance , or loyalty ? __eou__ We're working on different steps in different areas.For example , our Colbert line is thriving in American markets , we've already reached the loyalty stage.In Asia , however , it's a different story.Most people haven't even heard of Colbert , so we're working on awareness through a lot of product launches and related activities . __eou__ What are you doing to increase understanding in the European sector ? __eou__ Understanding comes from product differentiation.We get that through product demonstration , literature , expert testimonials , and the like . __eou__
The product's selling points is its advanced technoledge . __eou__ Unfortunately , it's just too expensive for majority of consumer to afford . __eou__ Why is the price so high ? __eou__ It's not just that the price is high , it's that the overhead to update an entire computer system to be compatible is costly . __eou__ Model of computers aren't compatible ? __eou__ Most current computer systems simply can't handle it because this model truly has extraordinary capabilities . __eou__ Maybe after the next generation of technology comes out , the price of this model will become more affordable . __eou__ But by then , the technology will be outdated . __eou__ True , but our focus has never been affordability anyway . Coastwise , we may not be very competitive , but qualitywise , we definitely have an edge . __eou__ That's right , no one else has a product on the market now that is comparable . __eou__ This model has advanced technoledge , superior components , it is compact , and it's a top-quality product . __eou__ I guess you get what you pay for . __eou__
Didn ’ t you punch in this morning , Monica ? __eou__ Sorry , I don ’ t know the rule about punching . __eou__ That ’ s ok . I should have told you earlier . This is a company rule . __eou__ Do we also need to punch out after work ? __eou__ According to the company rule , we should punch in before 8 o ’ clock and punch out after 5 o ’ clock every work day . __eou__ How about the lunch break , Lucy ? __eou__ From eleven thirty to 1 o ’ clock . __eou__ May I ask whether we need to work overtime ? __eou__ Sometimes , but not quite often . __eou__

Hello . __eou__ Hi , Lucy , are you free to talk ? __eou__ Not really , I ’ m in a meeting . Can I call you back in ... say ... 15 minutes ? __eou__ Sure , speak to you later . It isn ’ t urgent . Maybe it is easier if I send you an e-mail . __eou__ Ok , I ’ ll look out for it . Sorry , I can ’ t talk now . __eou__

Good afternoon . I suppose you are Ms . Monica . My name is Mr . Thomas , the general manager of ABC Company . Here is my business card . __eou__ Thank you very much . __eou__ I am very impressed by your resume . Therefore , I am very interested to know why you ’ re willing to leave your current company . __eou__ I am looking for a more challenging position . I can ’ t grow anymore in my current job . __eou__ Ok , I understand . But why you choose us to work for ? __eou__ I have studied carefully the information about your company on the internet and I have checked your company ’ s homepage . I am impressed by the company . And I like the products a lot . Since you ’ re growing steadily , I would be very eager to help you to improve your accounting system . __eou__ How do you work with a team ? __eou__ I work quite well with a team . I ’ m a good team player . I respect people , cooperate well with member ’ s team . And I will do my best to help team members . __eou__ What ’ s your long term goal ? __eou__ I ’ d like to bring to ABC Company not only my technical skills , ambition , enthusiasm , but also my loyalty , a sensor desire to become an administrative assistant . It is the hardest of my career plans . __eou__
I take care of the letters . I may read , sort out and organize incoming mails . __eou__ So you have to open all the envelopes . __eou__ Yes , except the personal mail . And I also need to prepare the materials for posting and check the e-mail box regularly . __eou__ Do you need to file copies of the letters before sending them ? __eou__ Yes , and I check all the e-mails for Mr . Thomas . __eou__ I take care of the letters . I may read , sort out and organize incoming mails . __eou__ So you have to open all the envelopes . __eou__ Yes , except the personal mail .

I've got some great news for you ! __eou__ Did you get the position you wanted ? __eou__ Yes , I'll be promoted to department manager . __eou__ I'm glad to hear that . Congratulations ! __eou__ Thank you . Actually , I could not believe it at first . You know , there're so many outstanding people in our company . Many of them are qualified to fill that position . __eou__ Sure , but you really did great and outperformed the others . You deserved it ! __eou__ Thank you very much . __eou__
Right , that ends the third and final part of our presentation . I'd like to end by emphasizing the main points . I'll give you a brief summary . There are three potential areas for development in the future , domestic , overseas market , and the internet . Each of these markets have their own particular need for marketing strategy ... for domestic , we can rely on past research , for overseas markets we depend heavily on our cultural consultants , and for the internet , we need to redo our image to appeal to a young set of consumers . Our main issue here is that we need to be sensitive to the needs of different markets in order to continue to see success . Mark , did you have anything to add ? __eou__ Yes , I want to restate one more time the importance of reinventing our company's image to appeal to different customer bases . I want to end with a true story that has to do exactly with what we've been talking about today ... __eou__
It is enough for today . Do you have any last question ? If not , thank you for taking your time to come to our interview . __eou__ You ’ re welcome . For the moment , I have no further questions . I got a good picture of the job and the company . All my questions have been answered . Thank you for your time . __eou__ We will have an internal discussion and then we will contact to inform you of our decision on whether we continue with you or not . __eou__ Ok , it was very nice to talk with you and I look forward to your decision at your earliest convenience . Bye . __eou__ Goodbye . __eou__
What are in this folder ? __eou__ They are reports of our company . __eou__ Are they filed alphabetically ? __eou__ No , they are filed according to dates . __eou__ Can you find last month ’ s report for me , please ? __eou__ No problem , here you are . __eou__
Okay , here are the graphs and figures for this month's sales . Let's review them all together . __eou__ This first one , I have a question ... This graph is marking the sales performance for our line of hair products , right ? Can this line be right ? It looks like our sales plummeted . I can't believe we did that poorly ... If I remember correctly , sales went down slightly , but not as dramatically as the graph shows . __eou__ I think you are looking at the wrong line . The rapid drop in sales wasn't our hair products . You are correct , the hair product sales decreased slightly , but not dramatically . The one that didn't do so hot this month was the cleaning products . I think there was a problem in the marketing plan . Some people were offended by our advertisements for the cleaning products , but it was already too late to mitigate the damage , so our mistake shows up in the sales . __eou__ Well , the good news is the new industrial cleaning products really took off . Look how the sales have shot up over the last two weeks . __eou__ That is our one major success . If you look at the other graphs , you can see that most of the other product lines remained steady with little increase . __eou__ At lease they stayed the same . That's better than dropping . __eou__
Hi , I am afraid that the fax machine in my room won ’ t be working till tomorrow . A technician has just come and checked it . He will bring me a new one tomorrow . It seems there is a big problem with mine and it will take some days for repairing . Can I use the one in your office ? __eou__ Of course you can . I am sure this one works very well . I just sent dozens of pages . How many pages are you sending ? Are you familiar with my fax machine ? __eou__ Yes , I think you have the same model as I have . Does your fax machine print out immediately a transmission protocol ? __eou__ Yes , it will print immediately . __eou__
I can ’ t make out anything , the words are too light . I thought they have already changed the toner cartridge this month . __eou__ It seems not or somebody has recently received a large fax . __eou__ Ok , no problem . We do it ourselves . __eou__ Do you know how to do it ? I am not so good at machine things . I will have somebody do it as soon as possible . __eou__ Check with somebody from the IT department . They are anyway in charge of the office electronic equipment . __eou__
I am waiting for a fax but just now I found there ’ s something wrong with the fax machine . __eou__ What ’ s wrong with the fax machine ? Is it urgent ? __eou__ Yes , very urgent . And there is no other fax machine around . And the office of our boss is closed , so I can not use his machine either . And his secretary is out . Do you have any suggestion ? __eou__ Either call this extension number 0085 or ask them to send the fax to you as e-mail , you print it out . __eou__
Would you please mail these letters , Lucy ? __eou__ Yes , Sir . __eou__ These two are urgent letters and should be sent by registered express airmail . Others are ordinary letters . __eou__ All right , who should I send them to ? __eou__ It ’ s sent to Mr . Charles . I believe he is in London . __eou__ Ok , home or office address ? __eou__ Office address , please . He might be at work when they arrive . __eou__ Should I enclose this commercial paper with these two letters ? __eou__ Yes , it ’ s right . __eou__
Look , the printer isn ’ t functioning well . I ’ Ve pushed the start button . It is suppose to be working now but it remains like a log . What ’ s going on ? __eou__ Let me check . It has a paper jam . __eou__ I didn ’ t pay attention to that . I will try to get the paper out . __eou__ Be careful , the cartridge can be very hot . __eou__
Please tell me how to file things according to the concerned rules . __eou__ Well , all right . There are four points you should keep in mind when you file documents , information and other things . __eou__ What are they ? __eou__ They are , keep the documents in chronological order , remove all the chips and pins , punch the documents evenly and place them in the folder . __eou__ And what is the most important point ? __eou__ You should always remember that one customer on file is the rule . __eou__
Hello , this is Francis . __eou__ Hi , this is Monica . I was wondering when we can work on this financial report . __eou__ Today , I am busy all day long . __eou__ Shall I see you on Friday morning ? __eou__ That ’ s not good for me at all.It ’ ll have to be another time . __eou__ We must find some time to read report . __eou__ I know . I am available from 1 PM to 4 PM on Friday afternoon . __eou__ That ’ s all right . Then see you on Friday afternoon . __eou__ See you . __eou__
Lucy , I ’ d like to fix the light in the corridor , it keeps flashing , which drives me crazy . Would you like to help me with the ladder ? __eou__ Monica , wait a moment . I think we ’ d better call the repair man to do it . __eou__ I think I can handle it by myself . __eou__ I ’ d like you to have a look at the safety manual of our company . __eou__ I see . If I got hurt when fixing the light , even during office hours , I wouldn ’ t get compensation from our company since repairing is not my responsibility . __eou__ Other company rules also need your attention . __eou__ Like this one ? Never wear loose clothes or hair when operating the shredder.Yeah , thank you for telling me . __eou__ Don ’ t mention it . __eou__
We have the orientation this afternoon . __eou__ What ’ s going to be covered in the orientation ? __eou__ The company introduction , our mission , vision , various policies , insurances , pension plan , company ID , batch , telephone , e-mail set-up and training . __eou__ Quite a lot . All them one afternoon ? __eou__ Yes , it is not easy . __eou__ It is ok with me . I enjoy being busy and learning new things . __eou__
Hello , this is Lucy from ABC Company . Is this Monica ? __eou__ Yes , it is . __eou__ I am calling to inform you that we have arranged an interview for this accountant position at 2 PM this Thursday afternoon . Please come on time . __eou__ Ok , thank you . By the way , could you please tell me how I can get there from A community ? __eou__ Oh , you can take the subway , get off at B stop and walk north for several minutes . You will find a building . It will take about 40 minutes in total . __eou__ I got it . Thank you so much . __eou__ You ’ re welcome . __eou__
Good afternoon . How can I help you ? __eou__ Good afternoon . My name is Monica . I am here for the job interview at 2 PM . __eou__ Ok , please first fill in the form and return it to me . You can do it in the next door . __eou__ Done . Here is my paper . __eou__ Everybody attention . I would like to make sure you all know the process . The interview consists of three parts . One , all of the interviewees will answer the question there and lasts for maximum one hour . Two , we will take a 30 - minute ’ s break . After the break , we all come back to this office and I will announce the successful candidates for the 2nd round . In which , you have a small interview with your future manager . __eou__ What about the 3rd round ? __eou__ Good question . But I will tell you when you pass the first two . __eou__
What ’ s up ? __eou__ I guess there is some kind of virus seeking into my computer , I can ’ t send out this e-mail . Do you have the number of the text port ? __eou__ Do you mind I have a look at your computer ? __eou__ Of course not , I appreciate that . __eou__ Well , it has nothing to do with virus . The problem is your attachment is a bit larger . It has exceeded the e-mail capacity . __eou__ I see . What can I do now ? __eou__ You can send a compressed one . __eou__
The demographic reports are in ... From the looks of it , we're going to have to re-evaluate some of the content for our promotional events in different venues . __eou__ Why , what's the lowdown ? __eou__ According to the report , our Boston crowd is quite different make-up from our Chicago folks . Our Boston consumers are mostly from mid-level to upper-class income levels , university or postgraduates , married no children , white collar ... You know the kind . Chicago on the other hand is mostly mid to low income levels , single parent homes , blue collar ... I think we're talking about two totally different target groups . __eou__ I have no idea there was that great of deviation between the two venues ... To make our products sell , we have to take the target audience into account . __eou__ No kidding . We've got to come up with two completely different sales pitches to suit the needs of each groups . __eou__
Excuse me , could you please show me the way to the human resource department ? __eou__ Yeah , but have you made an appointment ahead ? __eou__ Yes , of course . I am Monica . I have made an appointment with your HR manager . __eou__ Just a minute please . I ’ ll make a call to the HR office . Yes , they confirm your appointment . Please come in . it is on the 3rd floor , room 3106 . You can take the right elevator as the left on is in maintenance today . __eou__ Thank you very much . __eou__ You ’ re welcome . __eou__
How come it is slow as a snail today ? __eou__ You mean the network connection ? __eou__ Yes , I wanted to look for some information on the company page just now . It took me almost one minute to open it . Then there is no response to any click . __eou__ I have the same question . I can ’ t send out mails . We ’ d better call the IT department and ask them to check it immediately . __eou__ Ok . __eou__
What's holding us back on the plant expansion project ? We were supposed to see the specs on that ages ago.Why haven't I heard anything about it ? Did the whole project just vanish into thin air ? __eou__ No , sir . The plant expansion project has been delayed.There was a snag up in the fling process to get the necessary construction permits.It seems that the property we were slated to build on is also habitat for some endangered indigenous species . __eou__ You're joking , right ? No wonder we've been tied up with this project . I know the environmental impact statement will take forever to get approval if they've found anything endangered on the site . Are they positive there is evidence of endangered species actually living there ? __eou__ The environmental review board has a team on it now.Hopefully we'll know more by the end of the week . __eou__
How long will it take for our order to be delivered ? __eou__ Let's see . You are importing fifty containers of textiles from China . They should be able to place your order before the end of next week . It will take 2 days for shipping to the port city of Ningpo . The freight will take 3 weeks on the open ocean and will arrive in Los Angeles approximately a month from today . Domestic shipping will be your responsibility , you can make arrangements with the pier in Los Angeles . __eou__ Fine , we will handle domestic shipping , but what about customs ? Will we have to pay tariff on our imports ? I hope we don't run into any problems with the border control . __eou__ No , the Chinese company has that all worked out . With the paperwork you receive with the shipment , you should be good to go . __eou__
Last month , we only had 40 hits on our site . Our products and prices are good , but the problem is that no one knows about our website . __eou__ If we want to get this internet business off the ground , we've got to do something fast . __eou__ We need to maximize the chances that our site will be at the top of search engine lists , but I'm not sure how to do it . __eou__ We've got to put more buzz words into the page text , so it will pop up when people search about our kind of products . __eou__ Yeah , you're right . We've got to get the most popular phrases there ... How else can we boost site traffic ? __eou__ I think one of the least costly ways to attract business is to ask some of our neighboring sites to offer links to our page inside of theirs . If they have related services , they may be willing to help us out . __eou__ I guess we could also put out a few advertisements for our website inside of the search engine . I would like to find the most effective way to let people know about our site and our products . __eou__
Have you seen the sales report for last quarter ? Who do you think is our digest threat ? __eou__ From the numbers , it seems like Forest Inc . is our digest competitor ... Le'Ban and Markford are also major contenders in our market . __eou__ Le'Ban is the new kid on the block , it's amazing they've had such tremendous success so soon ... With them on the scene , the competition is outthrough . __eou__ here's information about our competitor's recent market activities ... __eou__ Thanks , this will be a big help in putting together next quarter's marketing strategies . With competition this intense , we'll have to step up production even more . We need a price we can compete with . __eou__ We're in a very competitive environment . It's sink or saimin this market . __eou__ Better start swimming ! we've got to find a way to outsmart the other guys . I want a preliminarily strategic marketing plan on my desk by next Tuesday ... the competition never sleeps and neither should we . __eou__
How much do you have budgeted for our trip to Las Angeles ? __eou__ In total , it should be about $ 5,000 for the week conference . Would you like to see the breakdown ? __eou__ Yes , I want to know exactly where the money is going . Give me a detailed report . __eou__ First we have the airline tickets , which are $ 500 per person ; with four of us going , that's t $ 2,000 . For our accommodations , we're spending $ 80 a night , per room , for five days . That's another $ 800 . __eou__ Weren ’ t you able to find anything less expensive ? We're sharing rooms , right ? __eou__ I have two people to a room . The $ 80 room rate is the lowest I could find . With the conference going on that week , all the hotels have inflated their prices , they're making a killing . __eou__ So far we have $ 2,800 , what else ? __eou__ I have budget $ 25 per Peron per day for food expenses . That totals another $ 800 . And for other incidentals , like take fees , and tips , I have estimated about $ 400 . __eou__ Well , that's only $ 4000 . Didn't you tell me your budget was $ 5000 ? Where is the rest of the money ? __eou__ That's my buffer ... I wanted to leave a little room in the budget , just in case---it's better to be safe than sorry . __eou__
How did your company's fundraiser go ? __eou__ The fundraiser events went really well . We were able to partner with a few of our competitors , all in fun of course , to sponsor a marathon for the American Cancer Society . All of the people who participated it had a great time , and we were able to raise a lot of money to contribute to cancer research . __eou__ So how does it work ? How were you able to make money with the marathon ? __eou__ Each of the runners that participated the marathon race paid a ten dollar entrance fee . Also , they went door to door to get sponsors who pledged a dollar per mile that participants ran . All in all we were able to raise several thousand dollars . __eou__ Sounds like a great deal for the American Cancer Society . __eou__ In all honesty , it's also a great deal for our company . The exposure that we gained from sponsoring an invent like this was great for our image in the community . We accomplished as much as last year's advertising campaign , plus we were able to do a little fundraising for a good cause . __eou__
John , I'd like to see you in my office for a minute . __eou__ Yes , sir , I'll be there in just a moment . __eou__ John , I have been watching you . I've been paying attention to you over the last quarter and I'm impressed . You've done a tremendous job in tackling some difficult accounts . I just want to let you to know , after this month's performance reviews , I'm recommending you for promotion . __eou__ Gosh sir , thank you , sir ! I had no idea there were any positions opening up in our department . __eou__ Well , it's not going to be in our department . I've recommended you for an interdepartmental transfer . There's supervisory spot opening up in financial . I'm turning your name in for it . __eou__ Management ? Wow , I had no idea I could move so quickly from entry level to managerial staff . __eou__ You've earned it . __eou__
What's the deal with the Asia area sales ? Did you have a chance to look at any other reports that came in from the branch offices ? __eou__ We got numbers back from our offices in Beijing , Hong Kong , Taipei , Singapore and Tokyo , we're waiting on Bangkok and Kula Lumpur . __eou__ What do the preliminary figures tell you ? Any kinds of trends going on for the branches in the Far East ? __eou__ It's hard to say , because the branches are located in diversity different countries , cultural and social influences will definitely play a part in the success of the product in the various markets . __eou__ For example ? __eou__ For instance , some products that do very well in Tokyo branch are a flop in Malaysia.We ' re talking about different people with different lifestyles and different needs . Each of the branches takes these types of things into consideration when they compile their reports and their marketing plans . __eou__
Hello , this is Lucy from ABC Company . __eou__ Hello , Lucy . __eou__ I ’ m calling to see if you have made your decision . You are the right person we are seeking for . __eou__ Yes , I have decided to work with your company . __eou__ Good news for us . When can you start to work ? __eou__ It ’ s my honor to be one member of your company . I ’ d like to begin to work any time as you like . __eou__ Ok , please come to my office at 9 AM next Monday . I will introduce you to our boss . __eou__ No problem . Thank you for calling me . __eou__ You ’ re welcome . __eou__
Thank you all for coming to our monthly staff correlation meeting . Today we have a lot of new things to introduce to you all , there will be a lot of changes in company policy to accommodate better employee welfare . __eou__ Employee welfare ? What all does that include ? __eou__ In the past , our welfare program has consisted of benefits packages only , meaning partial health insurance coverage and retirement plan . But we hope to boost morale by increasing incentives and adding additional welfare considerations . __eou__ What kind of considerations are we talking about ? __eou__ It is proposed that from now on , employees will be given 10 paid sick days , in addition to their 2 week vacation periods . They will also be encouraged to maintain proper physical health with a company sponsored aerobics class on Friday nights . We have also consulted with the human resource department and have hired a new liaison between management and employees . Let ’ s all welcome Ms . Michelle Cain to our team as our company ’ s ombudsman . __eou__ Our company now has n ombudsman ? __eou__ Yes , that ’ s right . From now on , whenever you have a question or concern regarding anything that happens during the work day , Ms . Cain will be your advocate . If you believe there is anything inappropriate or unfair in the management practices , the ombudsman will be the first person you seek . Her job is to have your best interest at heart . __eou__
Are you free next thursday ? __eou__ Yeah , why , is there something going on Thursday ? __eou__ A bunch of us in the office are planning a retiring party for Bob , he's been with the office for ages , so everyone was really surprised to hear he took early retirement . __eou__ Bob is retiring , wow ... that's news to me , I had no idea Bob was that old , retirement's still sixty-five , right ? __eou__ Retirement age is still 65 , but I think more and more people are retiring earlier , I think Bob's in upper fifties already , he just looks pretty young . __eou__ Wow ... I thought he was early forty stops , why would he want to retire so soon ? __eou__ Well , I think you prepare it well and capture good savings , retiring early can give you a lot more time for travel and other activities , you should get out and enjoy the life you still can't , don't you think ? __eou__
Margaret , I'd like to follow up with the arrangements for our company retreat , to take place next month . We need to book the venue , make arrangements for speakers and door prizes , and set up all the activities and accommodations . Also , very important , we need to determine which of our staff will be eligible and will be available to go . We've got to get a head count in order to make reservations . __eou__ What's the criteria for staff to attend ? Are we only including our management team in this affair ? Or will we be extending invitations to lower level employees to attend ? __eou__ Lower level employees need not attend . The purpose of this retreat is for training , especially for our management team . We want to develop a well-oiled machine on our executive level . In order to get everyone to jell together , we've got to include some fun . That's the reason for the retreat . __eou__
Mr Hughes ? Do you have a minute ? I would like to discuss something with you . __eou__ What can I do for you ? __eou__ I was wondering , I have heard many of my co-wokers that your knowledge and experience in international markets is phenomenal . Also , I ’ Ve heard the rumor that you speak fluent Japanese . Is that right ? __eou__ Yes , that ’ s right . I do speak decent Japanese . __eou__ Right now I ’ m working on a product launch project to open up our Asian market . We have several upcoming events to take place for the Japanese cities . We ’ ll be heading to Tokyo next month to get things started . What I would like to talk to you about is joining our team to help bring this project to completion . __eou__ Exactly what kind of help did you have in mind ? __eou__ We aer looking for someone who is familiar with the market and cultural issues to act as an advisor to our marketing staff . We would like to set up a partnership , where we can help each other . __eou__ So if I can help you as a consultant , what is in for me ? __eou__ We could give you an uncite office , as well as potential to develop your own contracts in Japan.At the same time , after helping with our project , we will be willing to split our profit with you . __eou__
How often are stockholders meetings held ? __eou__ Stockholders meetings are held biannually . Usually the meetings are scheduled for spring and fall . In between the meetings , each stockholder receives biannual reports . Financial statements are made once a year . __eou__ What percentage of the stockholders actually attend the meetings ? I'm guessing not a large percentage ... __eou__ You're right , it's a low percentage . Also , in order to attend meetings , you have to hold a certain amount of shares . It's quite a large number , so most of the stockers are excluded from proceedings . __eou__ So , how much say do the stockholders really have ? __eou__ Unless they're united , very little ... __eou__
Please send this memo out to all the managerial staff ... there will be training for all the department heads next week . Attendance for managerial staff is mandatory , except for the financial department . Financial officers may participate if their schedules allow . __eou__ You would like me to send this to all managerial staff ? I'm sorry , sir , could you please clarify ? Who all is included in managerial staff ? __eou__ Managerial staff is anyone who is in a position of authority or responsibility , or who has anyone working under them . It includes all supervisors and department heads . __eou__ What about the senior account managers ? Do they count ? __eou__ No , they are in a position of leadership and have more experience than normal account managers , but they do not directly supervise others . They are not members of the managerial staff and will not be included in our training . __eou__
So tell me , what's the difference between the Board of Directors , the CEO , and the stockholders ? They all seems ot be the same group of people to me ... __eou__ No , there's a definite difference . You know , the stockholders are the people who own the company ... they're the financial control system . Then there's the CEO — the chief executive officer . He's the hot shot , the main guy who is the boss . If there is only one person with absolute power in the organization , everyone knows that the power will go to their head . It's too dangerous . That's the reason for a Board of Directors . The board is made up of people who are experts in the industry . They could be related to the organization , but more commonly , they are independent and non-biased . __eou__ How many people are on the board of directors ? __eou__ Usually not more than 15 , not less than 10 . They meet monthly , quarterly , or biannually to oversee an organization or company . They provide long term planing and vision , and also act as moral watchdogs rto keep the company in line . __eou__
Where is the boss ? I need him to sign a few documents . I checked in his office , but he is not there . Is he out of the office now ? __eou__ Yes . Today is Tuesday , so the boss went off to his MBA seminar class . He is out of the office every Tuesday and Thursday mornings , and he has classes all day Saturday and Sunday . __eou__ What's he studying ? __eou__ He is finishing up a special continue education program for executives . He can continue working , taking a few of classes here and there , and in 2 years he will complete his MBA . __eou__ Sounds like a tiring schedule.He ’ s probably got a lot of homework too , eh ? __eou__ The classes have him out of the office , so that is stressful for him . But as far as homework goes , it is a breeze for him . __eou__ Why is that ? __eou__ He just has his secretary do his homework for him . __eou__
Could you do me a favor and proofread my resume before I send it out to the human resources department ? __eou__ Sure , let me take a look ... Personal Information , Education , Experience , Training ... I think you should add another section for language . You speak three languages , so you might as well put that on your resume . __eou__ But languages don't have anything to do with engineering . Shouldn't everything I put on my resume have something to do with my field ? __eou__ Not necessarily . I think people would be impressed by your language abilities . It says something about your level of intellect and experience . Also , I think human resources directors want to see more of a well-rounded person in a resume . __eou__ It's just a piece of paper , you think that they can tell if I am a well-rounded person by looking at it ? __eou__ Well , you're right , the resume is limited in how much it can tell someone about a person . That's why job interviews are important to let people know the real you that they can't see from a piece of paper . But resumes can be helpful in explaining things and giving a good impression to a potential employer . __eou__
Francis , what ’ s that ? __eou__ Well , that is the chart showing our company ’ s organizational structure . __eou__ Could you tell me something about it ? __eou__ Ok . On the top , Mr . Thomas , the managing director , is responsible for running the company . __eou__ How many departments do we have ? __eou__ Four . They are production department , finance department , sales and marketing department and HR department . I directly report to Mr . White . He is on a business trip and is suppose to be back this morning . Probably you will be meeting him at lunch . __eou__ Ok . Who should I report to ? __eou__ Mr . White , too . __eou__
So , where can I start my work ? __eou__ Well , your job is to compile and analyze financial information to prepare entries to accounts . You ’ re also responsible for preparing profit and loss statements and monthly closing and cost accounting reports . __eou__ And I represent ? __eou__ Our company just concluded a business transaction . You can help with documenting varies financial sheets involved in this transaction . __eou__ Ok , thank you . __eou__ You ’ re welcome . Feel free to ask me any time you need help . __eou__
Hello Mr . Jones , please have a seat . Thank you for coming in today . I have read your resume . You completed University in England ? __eou__ Yes , I went to Cambridge . After graduation , I started right away into the advertising industry . Later , I made a bit of a switch to focus on marketing research . __eou__ So , what experience do you have ? __eou__ I have ten years marketing experience . This includes both entry level and management positions . In my last position , I worked my way up to being director of the marking department . __eou__ I can see that from your resume.Your last position was marketing director for a pharmaceutical company , is that right ? Later , why did you decide to leave your former post ? __eou__ I felt after five years in one place , I was ready for something new . I would like to have a job that is challenging , something that I can see and do new things every day . I loved many things about my former job , and I left with amiable feelings on both sides . I was just ready for something new . __eou__ I see . Do you want to work full-time or part-time ? __eou__ I would rather work full-time . __eou__ I'll make note of that . Now , what are your salary expectations ? __eou__ I am willing to negotiate , but I expect at least $ 40,000 a year . __eou__
How long does it take to get to downtown from here ? __eou__ It is 15 minutes ’ drive . __eou__ What companies do we have in our neighborhood ? __eou__ Mitsubishi , HP , IBM and many other famous corporations . __eou__ Does the 7th floor belong to our company too ? __eou__ Yes , our company has two floors , the 6th and 7th floor in this building . __eou__ It ’ s such a large firm . Do we have our own staff restaurant ? __eou__ Yes , at the end of the hall . __eou__
Bob , can I talk to you for a minute ? There have been some developments for the Stewart case that I really need to talk to you about . __eou__ Yeah , what's the matter now ? We've had so much trouble with this case already . Don't tell me there's more bad news . __eou__ Well , I'm afraid there is . I have some bad news for you about the results of the forensic tests ... there won't be any results . __eou__ What ? What does that mean ? Why won't there be any results ? __eou__ I hate to tell you this , but it seems that every shred of evidence that would help us to convict were destroyed in a laboratory fire . There's nothing left . I'm so sorry ... __eou__ Oh , no , you can't be serious . I never expect anything like this would happened . What are we going to do ? __eou__ There's nothing that can be done . Everything is gone . I wish I could tell you differently , but what has happened has happened . We will just have to figure out a way to move on . __eou__
We are going to need confirmation on these orders today , and delivery must be made before next Tuesday . Do you think you can handle that ? __eou__ We are willing to work with you , but do you think it would be possible to extend your confirmation deadline ? We need to check the warehouse to make sure the products are in stock . The earliest I will be to get back to you is tomorrow morning . __eou__ No , I must know today because we have to go to press for the advertisements . Is there anyway you can speed up the process of checking inventory ? __eou__ We can do that , but it will cost ... If we have to check our inventory with all our guys on overtime , you're looking at an increased cost of , I'd say , maybe 10 % . __eou__ Are you kidding ? __eou__ No , and let me tell you why ... If I make my guys stay over to check the inventory , I'll have to pay them at an overtime rate , which is time and a half . I estimate it will probably take 3 guys two hours to finish , that will be an increase on your labor fee by at least 10 % ... if you need the numbers that urgently , I can have them do it . Otherwise , we can wait until tomorrow morning , and I'll call you with the numbers after they're done . It's your call ... __eou__
Hello ? Ms . Patterson ? This is Bill from Workmate calling . I'm just wondering if you had a chance to look over the estimate I sent for your gala dinner project next month ... As I said in my email , we can help you with production according to your needs , but we will only be able to give insite management support services on a limited basis . __eou__ Oh , yes . I reviewed your estimate . But it seems like the project blueprint you sent with the estimate is not quite what we had in mind . Did you get a copy of the specs for this project ? __eou__ Yes , I have several copies , but they're all different versions ... The latest I have is version 12 , is that current ? __eou__ No . Later we decided to opt for the prior outline , version 7 . __eou__ Hold on , let me pull up your version 7 requirements ... Oh yes , no wonder our estimate is a little different from what you had in mind . I see the version 7 also includes 6 additional hostesses and a cocktail self-serve bar that wasn't in the version 12 . That will definitely add to your cost on this project ... __eou__
How can I help you ? __eou__ Yes , I am James Mason from Anderson and Associates . I would like to see Mr . Smith . __eou__ Do you have an appointment ? __eou__ Yes , he knows I'm coming . Our meeting is set for 2 o'clock . __eou__ I wonder if Mr . Smith forgot your meeting . I am afraid he left this office this morning and is not expected back until after 4 pm . Let me find out if he made arrangements for someone else to meet with you in his place . Will you please have a seat ? __eou__ Sure . __eou__ Yes , Mr . Mason , I just checked with our office manager , Ms . Terry , she said Mr . Smith briefed her on your project . She is just finishing up a meeting now . She could be with your shortly . Would you like me to show you around while you are waiting ? __eou__ That would be very nice . Thank you . __eou__ Right this way , Mr . Mason . We can start with our front office . When Ms . Terry is ready , you may take the elevator at the front to the 6th floor . There is a conference room already prepared __eou__
It is really exciting news . __eou__ What news ? __eou__ You don ’ t know ? The company is going to replace these old computers with the latest ones . __eou__ You know what we will get ? __eou__ We will all get a docking station on our own desk from which you can remove your laptop easily . And if you come back to office , you just reconnect your laptop with docking station . __eou__ What docking station ? __eou__ This is a kind of socket mounted to your desk . The socket has all the wire connections of the company line and all the other office automation equipments , like fax , copier , a screen , printer and scanner , and it will be very convenient . __eou__ Another big step forward in saving on our office equipment , I don ’ t need a desktop anymore . A laptop is enough . __eou__
How come it is slow as a snail today ? __eou__ You mean the network connection ? __eou__ Yes , I wanted to look for some information on the company page just now . It took me almost one minute to open it . Then there is no response to any click . __eou__ I have the same question . I can ’ t send out mails . We ’ d better call the IT department and ask them to check it immediately . __eou__ Ok . __eou__
Look at this survey conducted by a website . A quarter of the employees will spend an average of 10 minutes everyday online doing personal things . Hi , Francis , what about you ? __eou__ Well , I just spend 15 minutes as so checking my stock bonds and booking an air ticket for my mother . Anyway , I have done all my work and it is about the time to leave . __eou__ Though our company doesn ’ t have a return policy , limiting the personal use of internet , I don ’ t think the boss will like us to do that . __eou__ Certainly , work always comes first . __eou__ But it is lucky for us . The company computers don ’ t have software keeping tracks of websites we visit . I have shopped too often online these days . __eou__ Well , keep a low profile . __eou__
What ’ s up ? __eou__ I guess there is some kind of virus seeking into my computer , I can ’ t send out this e-mail . Do you have the number of the text port ? __eou__ Yes , Do you mind if I have a look at your computer ? __eou__ Of course not , I appreciate that . __eou__ Well , it has nothing to do with virus . The problem is your attachment is a bit larger . It has exceeded the e-mail capacity . __eou__ I see . What can I do now ? __eou__ You can send a compressed one . __eou__
Did you hear something ? __eou__ Oh , it is my cell phone ringing . I set it in the vibration mode . __eou__ It is a good habit to set your cell phone to vibrate . It is very annoying to hear the loud and sudden ring tone in quiet offices . __eou__ You are right . Some ring tone is just terribly loud . You can hear it even in the next door . It is really a kind of distraction . __eou__ Maybe we can write a report to the boss to see what can be done . __eou__ Good idea . __eou__
Have you read the new rules about using cell phone at work ? __eou__ Yes , not bad . Like turn your cell phone ringer off and find a private place to make calls which it ’ s showing your respect to your co-workers . __eou__ Well , but for this one , don ’ t bring your cell phone to meetings , I think it is not reasonable . What if there are some important calls ? __eou__ Well , this one is not compulsory . It is just suggestion . __eou__ I didn ’ t pay attention to that . __eou__
I take care of the letters . I may read , sort out and organize incoming mails . __eou__ So you have to open all the envelopes . __eou__ Yes , except the personal mail . And I also need to prepare the materials for posting and check the e-mail box regularly . __eou__ Do you need to file copies of the letters before sending them ? __eou__ Yes , and I check all the e-mails for Mr . Thomas . __eou__
What are in this folder ? __eou__ They are reports of our company . __eou__ Are they filed alphabetically ? __eou__ No , they are filed according to dates . __eou__ Can you find last month ’ s report for me , please ? __eou__ No problem , here you are . __eou__
A friend of mine has been taking an online career planning course these days . He told me the other day he has learned a lot from it . He recommended me to subscribe to it . What do you say ? __eou__ I think it is good if we know enough about career planning . We will make wiser choices . What else did he tell you about it ? __eou__ Well , just something in general , like several key steps in planning career and how to set specific and tenable goals . __eou__ Sounds practical ! To be honest , sometimes I feel puzzled about my future career . I am not sure if this job suits me the best though I work very hard on it and enjoy being a hard worker . I have always wanted to try something else and learn some new skills . __eou__ Making a decision to start over is not an easy thing to do . It seems that you need this course more than I do . I love my current job . If I take this course , I hope to learn some tricks to get myself more organized at work . If they can give suggestions about how to boost work relationships , that will be great . I need these to improve my current work performance . __eou__ Ok , then we can sign up for it together . __eou__
You didn ’ t show up in the morning meeting . What ’ s up ? __eou__ Well , I just came in . I worked overtime yesterday . Some statistics and very important documents seemed to be inaccurate . So I stayed to double check them . The boss was aware of my very late work of last night . So before he left office , he told me I could come one hour later this morning . __eou__ But you still look a little bit tired . What time did you leave ? __eou__ It was around 1 thirty in the morning . I guess I didn ’ t fall asleep till 3 because those numbers were involving in my mind . I just couldn ’ t stop thinking about them . __eou__ That ’ s normal after a tense work evening . Working overtime is not always a pleasant experience for me either . Once , I worked overtime everyday for a whole week including the weekend . That really broke my rhythm and I got a little sick later . __eou__ Working at weekend is something I hate to do most . __eou__ But if the company asks , what else can we do ? __eou__
Where were decorating and I ’ m going to ask some things . __eou__ Well , I ’ ll be glad to help you out . We can deliver what you need to your office . __eou__ Shall we need at 1 fifteen this Thursday ? We definitely need some new filing cabinets and at least one desk unit . __eou__ Fine , I ’ ll bring both our office furniture and equipment catalogs on Thursday . __eou__
Good morning . I ’ m Liu Yi , from China XYZ Company . We have an appointment with Mr . Thomas . __eou__ Welcome to ABC Company . We have been expecting you , please have a seat . I will call him . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ Mr . Thomas will be here very soon . In the meantime , may I ask all of you to sign in so that I can issue your passes ? __eou__ Should each of us write separately ? __eou__ Yes , please . Please print your name and company name , and the person you are going to see . __eou__
I am Liu Yi , from China XYZ Company . I ’ d like to see Mr . Thomas , please . __eou__ Do you have an appointment , Mr . Liu ? __eou__ No , I am afraid not . I just arrive in town today . __eou__ Mr . Thomas is quite busy , I ’ m afraid he won ’ t be able to see you today . __eou__ Would you please ask when he will be free ? __eou__ Have a seat please while I call . __eou__
How long have you been in this company ? __eou__ I came two years ago after I graduated from college . This is my first job . __eou__ You must have found much difference between working in company and studying in college . __eou__ Of course ! Everyday , there is a deadline to meet . Bosses watching and testing me all the time , not liking in college , handed in paper months later and tested on schedule . It is so busy . But anyway , I have been trying my best to be a good employee . __eou__ Well , you ’ Ve adapted yourself very well . Everyone in our office thinks you ’ Ve made a great progress in the past two years . What is your secret ? __eou__ It is so encouraging to hear this remark . The secret is to make plans . Write down your goals , short-term and long-term and make detail plans for a week or a month . Then just work hard . __eou__
Do you know that working overtime in some companies is a regular thing ? __eou__ How regular ? __eou__ An average ten hours or more a day according to a survey , the worst thing is that the employees get no pay for that . __eou__ You are kidding me ? It is against the labor law . They should be aware of their rights . __eou__ But these people say nothing about that . They are worried about losing their job because there is surplus in labor force these days . __eou__ That ’ s not right , somebody should do something . __eou__
I have been very busy this year , working late , often taking work home and taking no vacation . I feel exhausted . __eou__ You should ask for a holiday and relax yourself for a little bit . You worked so hard . __eou__ You are right . For the past few weeks , I had no appetite and couldn ’ t sleep well . What ’ s worse my back started aching this Monday . It is time for me to take a vacation . __eou__
Do you sometimes feel overwhelmed by your work ? __eou__ Of course ! It is the No . 1 stressor in my life . You know job stress has become a very common problem these days . So we must learn to cope with it . __eou__ Totally agree . What is your solution ? __eou__ Well , there are two causes of job stress . One is employee characteristic and the other is company condition . So if we want to manage job stress , both we and the companies should do something . For me , I am trying to balance work and leisure time . You know , all work and no play make Jack a dull boy . __eou__ You seem to have a very relaxed outlook . __eou__ It is necessary . Positive attitude helps to prevent stress . __eou__ But I don ’ t think we can change our working condition . Anyway , we are not the bosses . __eou__ I heard some companies are providing stress management training and making changes inside them , like avoiding unrealistic deadlines and organizing relaxation activities . Our boss is a smart person . He will be learning from that if he would like to an efficient and healthy team . __eou__
I am going on a business trip to Guangzhou next Monday morning . __eou__ To visit our supplier ? __eou__ Yes , as the New Year is coming , they ’ re organizing a party for all their customers . __eou__ Well , I guess you will meet many people in this field . So don ’ t forget to pack enough business cards in your suitcase . __eou__ Sure . __eou__ By the way , do you know that our company just made some changes in the business trip policy ? __eou__ No , no one has informed me of that so far , tell me . __eou__ Ok , there is no cash advance anymore for short trips . You have to pay out of your own pocket , so save all the receipts from your business trip . And then attach them to your expense account . When you get back , our company will reimburse everything . __eou__ I see . What about the maximum purdy and rate , any change ? __eou__ I am not sure . You can check with the finance department . __eou__ I will call them this afternoon , thanks . __eou__ You ’ re welcome . Have a nice trip . __eou__
Good morning , I am Monica . Are you Mr . White , the manager of finance department ? I am the newcomer and also working in the finance department . __eou__ Yes , that is me . Nice to meet you , Monica . Welcome on board ! __eou__ Thank you . I am very happy to have my own office now . I ’ Ve never had one before .

Hi , Francis , how was your business trip ? __eou__ It was a nightmare . __eou__ What ’ s up ? __eou__ Actually , the business trip itself was very successful . We arrived on time , we had nice conversations and we settled some important issues for the next year . __eou__ Sounds quite fruitful , why do you call it still a nightmare then ? __eou__ Well , the air line lost my luggage on the return flight and then I lost my carry on bag when I was tackling with the officers in charge . I left the airport three hours later than I expected and then I was caught in a traffic jam . When I finally got home , I was totally exhausted . But I found the elevator was out of service due to a blackout . __eou__ This is really a sad story . Did they trace back your luggage ? __eou__ I am still waiting for their call . __eou__ Take it easy , all sufferings have their reward . __eou__
Did you see the letter I got from Bradford Films ? They sent it in response to your phone call last week . __eou__ If they wanted to say something about my call last week , why didn ’ t they sand it to me ? __eou__ I guess they must not have your contact information , so they sent it addressed in care of your department head . Anyhow , they wrote to confirm in writing what you discussed about the Milton contract . __eou__ Can I see it for a second ? __eou__ Sure , here it is ... __eou__ Dear Mr . Clark , Further to our telephone call last Friday , I am writing to confirm our meeting on july 21 .

You should give them another call . __eou__

We'd like to welcome everyone to the Michelson Tools factory site , and thank everyone for being here today . My name is Paul Shafer , I'll be showing you around today . Please feel free to ask questions at any point during our tour , I'll be happy to answer questions for you . __eou__ Is it really necessary to wear all this protective gear ? __eou__ That's an excellent question . I'll bet your wondering why we ask you to wear hard hats and safety googles while you's in the plant . The reason is simple , we care about your safety and we want to ensure there are no injuries today . As you will see , to maintain a high level of safety , we also require all of our staff to wear similar protective gear . __eou__ How long will the tour take ? __eou__ It should take about twenty minutes to go through the main plant , and maybe another ten to take a look at the laboratory . All together our tour should last about half an hour . __eou__ Okay ... __eou__ Well , if you don't have any questions , shall we get started ? If you'll follow me , first I'll take you to the site of our semi-conductor system ... __eou__
Our toner cartridges are already out of ink ... Could you make an order for a new set ? __eou__ We will need new cartridges for all of the office printers ? That will be a large order , probably about two or three cases . The office supply store we usually go through might not have that many in stock . __eou__ You can double check with the housekeeping department , but I am pretty sure all of the machines will need new cartridges . Last time when we made our order to the supplier , the quantity was also especially high . They are used to receiving such bulk orders from us . As long as we give them a heads up a couple days in advance , they can usually fill the order . __eou__ OK , I will make a few calls and run our order by housekeeping first to make sure . Is there anything else we need to order while I am at it ? __eou__ I think the only thing is toner . Try to see if they can deliver it before the end of business day tomorrow . We should really try to do better about waiting until the last minute to fill orders that are usually made on a monthly basis . Anyhow , see what you can do to expedite the order this time . __eou__ OK , will do . __eou__
Did you put this morning's faxes on my desk ? I'm waiting for some urgent faxes from headquarters , I'm pretty sure they came in last night . __eou__ Everything that came in off the fax machine last night is all on your desk . But I noticed that some of the faxes came through pretty blurred . Maybe you can take a look at them . If the copy is unreadable , I'll call them and ask them to relax . __eou__ Yeah , you're going to have to call them and get them to be re-faxed . These copies are so dark , I can't make out any of the words . __eou__ What about that one ? __eou__ This one ? This one is so light I can barely read it . How can that be ? __eou__ You know , I think the fax machine is out of toner , I can change the toner cartridge . That should solve the problem . __eou__ Yes , but this one will have to be re-faxed as well . And look , there's about three pages missing ! It looks loke the fax machine ate half my important faxes , and the ones that made it through are so blurred or too light , they're unreadable ! __eou__ I guess the fax machine is out of paper , too . Don't worry , I'll have someone look at it this afternoon , and in the meantime , I'll have your documents re-faxed to our other fax machine . __eou__

Let's begin by having you tell me about yourself and your background . __eou__ I have been working as a paralegal for the last 10 months through an agency that specializes in the legal field . My experience has been supporting attorneys in the field of labor law , where I have been able to apply my paralegal education . I was commended on my ability to take information and break it down into usable facts . I really love research and analyzing facts . My major in college was English , and as a result , my writing skills are my major strength . I am looking for a position where my research and writing skills can be used . __eou__ What do you think are the key qualities needed to succeed in the paralegal profession ? __eou__ Flexibility would certainly rank high in this type of job . In my last position , I supported four lawyers , and it was not unusual for them all to give me high-priority items to do in the same day or week . There were days when I had to stop and prioritize my work just to get a handle on everything . I would discuss the urgency of their work with each of them so I didn't drop the ball . At the same time , I made sure each of them felt like his or her project was important on my agenda . I think communication is probably the next key quality . It really worked well when I talked with each of them , explained my situation , and got their input . __eou__ Can you give me an example of a time when you had to work above and beyond your job description ? __eou__ There was a very important project that had to be researched and completed by the end of the week . Even though I worked extra hours every night for almost two weeks , my boss and I stayed until 2 a . m . for two nights before the final wrap up . It was very rewarding to have put so much effort into a project and see the really great results . My boss gave me a bonus for my extra effort . __eou__ Tell me about a time when you had to research a case and encountered some obstacles you had to overcome . __eou__ I remember a case that was filled with obstacles . The first thing I did was research through documents and past cases that had similar circumstances . I assembled the facts and then tried to put them together and analyze the next step . I was able to get some input from another lawyer I happened to see at lunch . Through some hard work and fact digging , I was able to find a way to overcome most of the obstacles . I took my findings to my boss and made some recommendations , which she and I discussed and eventually resolved.My boss was impressed with the work I had done . __eou__ What are your strengths and weaknesses ? __eou__ My strengths are my caring about getting the job done . I am very results-driven and have been able to meet all my deadlines in past jobs . As far as weaknesses , I really enjoy my work , and sometimes I put in too much time . But I am aware of my tendency to overwork and have learned to pace myself more . __eou__ Tell me about a time when you had a confrontation with a coworker or boss . __eou__ I did have an issue with someone who was getting on my nerves . I asked her if I could talk with her one day , and we had a good discussion . It turned out she was not aware of the impact of her actions and that she really needed an explanation of the procedure . I took the time to explain the procedures , and there haven't been any problems since that day . __eou__ When do you find a job satisfying ? __eou__ My biggest satisfaction is when I experience growth in a job . When I first started as a paralegal , I had a lot to learn . But through hard work , advice from some good mentors and continuing education , I have come a long way .

On a scale of one to 10 , what would you say morale was in this company ? __eou__

I am sure I will be successful . __eou__ How do you know about this company ? __eou__ Your company is very reputed in this city . I heard much praise to your company . __eou__
What kind of person do you think you are ? __eou__ Well , I am always energetic and enthusiastic . That's my strongest personality . __eou__ What are your strengths and weaknesses ? __eou__ Em , as I have said , I'm diligent and industrious . On the other hand , sometimes I'm too hard-working and I put myself under too much pressure to make things perfect . __eou__ What qualities would you expect of persons working as a team ? __eou__ To work in a team , in my opinion , two characteristics are necessary for a person . That is , the person must be cooperative and aggressive . __eou__ How do you spend your leisure time ? __eou__ I like playing games and having sports . They are my favourite hobbies . __eou__ So , what kind of sport do you like most ? __eou__ Oh , it's hard to narrow it down to just one . I mean , I like all kinds of sports , basketball , swimming , bike riding and so on . Maybe it is just the reason why I am so energetic and vigorous . __eou__
Tell me a little bit about yourself , please . __eou__ My name is Dunlin and I live in Beijing . I was born in 1980 . I will graduate from Peking University this July . I have majored in accounting . __eou__ Would you tell me something about your family ? __eou__ There are three in my family , my parents and myself . My father is a teacher and my mother is a worker . __eou__
What kind of character do you think you have ? __eou__ Generally speaking , l am an open-minded person . __eou__ What is your strongest trait ? __eou__ Cheerfulness and friendliness . __eou__ How would your friends or colleagues describe you ? __eou__ They say Mr . Sun is a friendly , sensitive , caring and determined person . __eou__ What personality do you admire ? __eou__ I admire a person who is honest , flexible and easy-going . __eou__ How do you get along with others ? __eou__ I get on well with others . __eou__
Woo hoo ! This just might be the start of the rest of my life ! __eou__ What happened ? __eou__ I ’ m in the market for a job ! I went on a website with hundreds of job listings in the area and browsed through them until I got the names of a few employers I would like to work for . I have the resume I wrote for English class last month and a cover letter will be a piece of cake to write . I ’ Ve even done my research and found the names of the managers so I can address the letters personally . And you know I can be charming in interviews . Goodbye my penniless days ! Hello salary and a career ! __eou__ Ben , we ’ re fifteen . What kind of job are you looking for ? __eou__ Oh , just for a position as a gas station attendant . You know , starting at a simple lowly job , just like all the greats before they made it big in the world . __eou__ Uh-huh . __eou__ But I ’ m just in it for the money , right ? How else am I going to be able to afford to keep taking Angela to the movies ? Besides , I love the smell of gasoline , don ’ t you ? __eou__
Now , Miss Childs passed on your resume to me and I ’ Ve had the chance to look it over and I must say I ’ m quite impressed . __eou__ Thank you very much . I ’ Ve tried to keep it short and clear.If there ’ s any questions please feel free to ask me . __eou__ Well yes , I do have a number of questions , but perhaps first you could give me a brief overview I ’ d like to get a little bit of an idea of your background . __eou__ Yes , of course . Well as you can see from the resume I ’ m 27 and grew up in Brooklyn , New York , although our family moved to London when I was quite young , at around 16 . __eou__ Ah I see , so you were actually educated in Europe ? __eou__ Yes precisely . Although I was born in the US , I would definitely call London home . But as you see I ’ Ve actually spent a lot of my life moving from country to country . My Father was in the oil business __eou__ Very interesting . So it seems you had quite an adventurous childhood . __eou__ Absolutely ! We were never still for too long . But now I ’ m really looking to settle down . __eou__ I see . Okay , well let ’ s move on to discuss your education shall we ? __eou__ Sure . __eou__
I ’ m glad you could find time to meet with me , Mr . Johnson . I can ’ t think of a nicer environment for our meeting today , the ambiance here is lovely ! __eou__ No problem , if possible I always combine business with pleasure . Now , let ’ s hear more about these chocolates you ’ re offering . __eou__ Well , as you know , I have recently become the sole distributor for Grangers Gourmet Bon-bons here in the United States . They ’ re a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market . Naturally , your restaurant sprang into my mind immediately . I think your brand exemplifies many of the same traits as Grangers and serving these chocolates would really add to your reputation for providing elegant , luxurious , first class dining . __eou__ Mmmm , sounds interesting ... gourmet chocolates , where are they produced ? Belgium ? __eou__ Actually , the factory is located in Scotland . __eou__ Really ? I didn ’ t think they were known for their luxury chocolate production ... __eou__ That ’ s what makes this such a fantastic opportunity ! The government is one hundred percent supportive of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a low tariff for all wholesale orders of over one thousand units . They ’ Ve also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well . Here , I brought these especially for you , try one ! __eou__ Oh , thanks . Mmm , hmm , creamy texture , very smooth ... __eou__ Unique , aren ’ t they ? I bet you ’ Ve never tasted anything like it ! Quality is assured as I personally visit the factory to make sure no one ’ s cutting corners with the ingredients . Only the creme make it through inspection . __eou__ Yes , very interesting flavors ... Slightly spicy , very unique , that ’ s for sure . Exactly what ARE the ingredients ? __eou__ I have it on highest authority that this traditional secret recipe has been handed down in the Granger family for generations . I ’ m sure you can keep a secret.Buttermilk , cacao beans , sugar and Haggis . __eou__ Haggis ? What ’ s Haggis ? __eou__ It ’ s a traditional Scottish delicacy ; you take sheep ’ s liver , heart and lung and stuff it inside of the sheep ’ s stomach . __eou__
Hello . Is this Ann ? __eou__ Yes , it is . Kelly ? __eou__ Yes , it's me . __eou__ Do you have a cold ? __eou__ No . Worse than that . I have a flu . I'm in bed with a fever . __eou__ Oh , no ! What about your presentation today ? __eou__ I'd like to do it , of course . But I just can't . I'm afraid I'd fall down in the middle of it . __eou__ I understand . What should I tell Mr . Morley ? __eou__ Why not just tell him I'm sick ? I'll ring him myself this afternoon . __eou__ Alright . Have you been to see a doctor ? __eou__ Not yet . I feel too lousy to go out.Anyway , I have a flu . I know what it is . I don't need a doctor to tell me that . __eou__ Do you think you'll be able to come in tomorrow ? Or should I call off your appointments for tomorrow too ? __eou__ I'm not sure yet.Maybe this will all be gone in a day . So it's probably better if you don't call off my appointments . I will call you later this afternoon and tell you what I think . __eou__ It's rainy weather today . Maybe it's better if you just stay inside.Make yourself some chicken soup and sleep . __eou__ Yes , that's what I plan to do . Except I won't make the chicken soup.Right now I don't think I could swallow more than a spoonful of it . __eou__ That bad , huh ? __eou__ Yeah , I'm very nauseous .

And so , I just wanted to check in with you and find out where we are with this project . As you know , you ’ Ve missed a fairly significant deadline last week , and this will negativity impact the team ’ s ability to move forward with the next stages of this project . __eou__ I know , I ’ m really sorry that I missed the deadline . But really , it wasn ’ t my fault . You see , we had all of these unexpected technical problems at the last minute , and that I couldn ’ t get into the database and extract the kind of information that I needed for the data analysis . You know , if the tech guys would have done their job and kept the ARM stable , then I wouldn ’ t have missed my deadline . __eou__ Oh , come on ! An excuse like that is tantamount to lying . You ’ re essentially blaming the tech team for your time management issues , rather than accepting responsibility for the fact that you were procrastinating for the past two weeks . __eou__ No , I ’ m not trying to pass the buck here ; I know that it was me who is ultimately responsible for getting this done . But the thing is , I could have finished on time if the system hadn ’ t gone down . And you know , with everything I ’ Ve got going on now , I can ’ t afford to waste time dealing with technical problems . I ’ Ve got a lot on my plate and there are only twenty-four hours in a day ... __eou__ I ’ m not going to accept this excuse . You ’ re using these small technical glitches as a crutch and trying to rationalize the fact that you ’ Ve missed your deadline . Look , we have standards and I expect you to live up to those standards . No more phoney cases . If you ’ re in over your head , you tell me . No more missed deadlines . Now , I want that data on my desk by nine am ! __eou__

They ’ re an IT service company that offers comprehensive business solutions for large corporations . They provide services such as ARM development , and they also offer customdesigned applications . __eou__ So what would your role in the company ? __eou__ Well , the position is for an account manager .

Thanks for coming in today , did you have any trouble finding us ? Please take a seat . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ So , let ’ s get started . tell me a bit about your educational background . __eou__ Sure ! Well , I graduated with honors from Chesterton University with a major in Business Administration , with a specialization in Information Management , and I minored in psychology . I chose this course of study for two reasons . I wanted to gain some practical , marketable skills , which the information management track provided , and I also feel that interpersonal skills are essential for professional success , hence the minor in psychology . __eou__ Interesting . And , your postgraduate studies ? __eou__ Well , I am really passionate about consumer behavior , so I pursued a master ’ s in that area . I also strive to keep my professional skills current , so I continuously attend seminars and conferences related management and customer service . __eou__ Very good . Now , tell me a little bit about your work experience . I see here that you previously worked at Oracle . __eou__ Yeah , I worked as their customer support manager , which brought me a breadth of experience in both client care , and process management . I supervised and coordinated the customer support team as well as implemented new strategies to achieve better customer satisfaction . __eou__ Interesting ... __eou__ Yes , in this position I was able to make some pretty significant contributions to the overall success of the company . With the different initiatives that we implemented , we lowered our churn rate to about five percent , which had a direct impact on revenue . __eou__
So , Lauren , I just wanted to talk to you quickly about our new customer support representative , Jason Huntley . __eou__ Sure , what ’ s up ? __eou__ Basically , I ’ Ve got a few concerns about him , and the bottom line is , I don ’ t think he ’ s a good fit for our company . __eou__ Okay ... what makes you say that ? I thought you were pleased with his overall performance . Didn ’ t you just tell me last week how impressed you were with his attitude ? __eou__ Yeah , his attitude is great , but he ’ s really unreliable.Sometimes he ’ s really productive , but then other times ... take last Tuesday for instance , he was forty-five minutes late for our morning meeting ! __eou__ Well , I ’ m sure he had a perfectly good reason ... __eou__ But that ’ s not the only thing ... you know , he really doesn ’ t have the best work ethic , I ’ m constantly catching him on MSN and Facebook when he should be talking to clients . __eou__ Yeah , but come on , Geoff , as if you don ’ t check Facebook at work . Look , you hired this guy , we ’ Ve invested a lot of time and money in his training , so now it ’ s up to you to coach him . Make it work , Geoff ! __eou__ Make it work , Geoff . You would say that , wouldn ’ t you , he is your cousin.what a jerk , make me hire your stupid , useless , cousin . __eou__
So , Casey , how are things going with the photos for the press kit ? __eou__ Yeah , I ’ Ve been meaning to talk to you about that . I might need to ask for an extension on that deadline . __eou__ You ’ Ve had over a month to get this finalized ! Why are things delayed ? __eou__ Well , the thing is , we ran into a lot of problems . . . __eou__ I ’ m not looking for excuses here . I just want to get this finished on time ! __eou__ I know , and I apologize for the delay . But some things were just beyond my control . I had trouble booking the photographer , and then Michael was sick for three weeks , so I couldn ’ t include him in the photos , and the design team lost all the files , so I had to re-do the pictures . __eou__ I ’ m not going to put this off any longer , Casey !
