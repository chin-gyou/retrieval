Could you project what you would like to be doing five years from now ? __eou__ As I have some administrative experience from my last job , I may use my organizational and planning skills in the future . __eou__ How do you plan to accomplish this ? __eou__ By doing everything necessary and for further study . __eou__ How long would you like to stay with this company ? __eou__ How long I will stay with the company depends on whether the company and I are satisfied with each other . __eou__ What do you think of this industry's outlook in five years ? __eou__ I do believe this industry will be developed rapidly in 5 years time . __eou__
What is your salary at present ? __eou__ My present pay is 100,000 Yuan per year . __eou__ What are your salary expectations now ? __eou__ I like to be paid more than that . Hopefully , 120,000 Yuan per year . __eou__ That's a little more than we had planned . __eou__ I think you'll find I'm worth that . __eou__ I can only offer you 110,000 Yuan a year . Raises will be given after a three-month probation according to your performance . Is that satisfactory ? __eou__ Yes , it is quite reasonable . __eou__
How long do you plan to stay here ? __eou__ To speak frankly , it doesn't depend on me . __eou__ How so ? __eou__ I really want to obtain a permanent job . I won't leave as long as I have opportunity to apply my knowledge and get on well with my superiors and colleagues . __eou__ What are your future plans and what kind of expectations do you have of the company ? __eou__ I know that generally it is possible to move from this position to a management position with two years experience in the company __eou__
How much do you expect to earn ? __eou__ I think salary is closely related to the responsibilities of the job . Shall we discuss my responsibilities with your company first ? __eou__ If you are hired , you are in charge of the design of toys that can meet the needs of the American market . __eou__ I know it is a crucial position , but I can do it well . So I'm asking for 200,000 Yuan a year as a starting salary . __eou__ Ok . __eou__
What's your expected salary ? __eou__ I expect to be paid according to my abilities . __eou__ How do you feel about an annual salary of 100,000 Yuan plus bonus . __eou__ That's a little less than I expected . But to me , the most important thing is the job and the people I will work with . Moreover , I am sure I will get a raise quickly depending on my background and experience . __eou__ That sounds very reasonable . __eou__ By the way , how long is my probation ? __eou__ Generally it is 6 months and during this period you are half-paid . __eou__

A lot people are going in and out . __eou__ Has anybody spoken to him about it ? __eou__ No , not yet , but someone ’ s going to have to . __eou__ We can ’ t really ask him to stop having students come in for help , can we ? __eou__ No , of course not . But I ’ m not able to do my work and neither are you . __eou__ How about recommending him to use the storage room down the hall ? __eou__ Oh , that would be too small . __eou__ With the cabinets taken out , it might be bigger than it looks . __eou__ Come to think of it , you may be on to something . Let ’ s go have a look . __eou__ Let ’ s rock n ’ roll . __eou__

We have the capital ready.Right now I am looking at three different companies to produce our products.And your company , Mr . Chen , seems to me to be the best for what we want . __eou__ I appreciate your remarks . And we are always happy to do more business.But , you know , if we take on a contract to produce new products , we want to be confident the product is marketable . Because , to start producing new things requires a lot of preparation.It requires a lot of investment for us . __eou__ You have some doubts about our products , I understand . __eou__ I would like to offer you a good price.But I won't be able to do that if I think this is a one-shot deal.So I would like to have some confidence in your idea . __eou__ Of course . Let me tell you in some detail about our idea.You know the popular Hello Kitty products . __eou__ Yes , of course . __eou__ Well , the products in themselves are very simple.It is the logo that is successful.So , Hello Kitty is successful because of the logo , but the products are very simple . __eou__ And I would say the logo is successful mainly because it comes from Japan.It is the Japanese that have made it a fad . __eou__ That might be true.But we have a logo concept that is great . It is really great . I think it will catch on in Taiwan at least . Young people will love it.It is because of our logo that our products will sell.We just need someone to produce the products for us.We have the backup and people to do the marketing . __eou__ So what you are really trying to sell is a fad . __eou__ Yes , we would like to make things like key chains , plastic pencil sharpeners , plastic rulers , watches , wallets , things like that.Little accessories for young people . But the reason these will sell is the logo.Just like Hello Kitty . __eou__ I understand . But why won't you show me the logo ? __eou__ Because it hasn't been copyrighted . We want to get some protection for it.But while we wait for copyright , we are investigating companies to produce the products . __eou__ I see . The problem , however , is that I can't be confident in giving you a good priceless I am confident your product will last . __eou__ I understand . For now , though , you could just give us an estimated price.We aren't going to sign a contract yet . We are just investigating . I only need to know that your company is capable of producing the products.And then , I only need a very rough idea of how much it might cost . __eou__ Alright . I understand . Right now you just want estimates . __eou__ Yes . __eou__
Can you help me do an internet search ? __eou__ Sure . What do you want to find ? __eou__ I want to find information on the American Civil War . __eou__ Well , can you be more specific ? There are a lot of websites about that . __eou__ Yes , I want to know about the battle of Gettysburg . __eou__ O . K . Well , go to google.com , and type in “ Battle of Gettysburg . ” __eou__ Oh wow , there are a lot of sites . __eou__ Here , try this one . It ’ s a good site about Gettysburg . __eou__ Thanks . __eou__ For detailed information , however , you should read a history book . __eou__ Thanks . If I ’ m interested , I ’ ll go to the library . __eou__
Hello , this is Peter Dixon from NEZ news radio . May I speak to Mr . Wilson please ? __eou__ Yes , speaking . __eou__ Good morning , Mr . Wilson . I ’ m calling to confirm the date of the next interview program . __eou__ Hold on a minute please . I ’ ll have my assistant check that part . __eou__

What about your presentation today ? __eou__ I'd like to do it , of course . But I just can't . I'm afraid I'd fall down in the middle of it . __eou__ I understand . What should I tell Mr . Morley ? __eou__ Why not just tell him I'm sick ? I'll ring him myself this afternoon . __eou__ Alright . Have you been to see a doctor ? __eou__ Not yet . I feel too lousy to go out.Anyway , I have a flu . I know what it is . I don't need a doctor to tell me that . __eou__ Do you think you'll be able to come in tomorrow ? Or should I call off your appointments for tomorrow too ? __eou__ I'm not sure yet.Maybe this will all be gone in a day.So it's probably better if you don't call off my appointments . I will call you later this afternoon and tell you what I think . __eou__ It's rainy weather today . Maybe it's better if you just stay inside.Make yourself some chicken soup and sleep . __eou__ Yes , that's what I plan to do . Except I won't make the chicken soup.Right now I don't think I could swallow more than a spoonful of it . __eou__ That bad , huh ? __eou__ Yeah , I'm very nauseous . It's mostly nausea and a fever . __eou__ Well , I'll cancel your appointments for today . And I'll tell Mr . Morley . __eou__ Thanks , Ann .

In my opinion , it may be necessary to charge for participation . __eou__ I'm not sure if that would be wise . __eou__ Then what is your opinion ? __eou__ Well , maybe we'll go to ask Mr . Johnson . He has the final say . __eou__
Marry ; Mr . Johnson wants these documents to be copied . __eou__ Oh , no . You see I'm in the middle of something . Could he wait ? __eou__ I'm afraid ... __eou__ All right , all right . He'll get them as soon as possible . __eou__
Could I have a word with you ? __eou__ Sure , what is it ? __eou__ I am disappointed with your work lately . __eou__ I'm sorry . I've been having some problems . __eou__
What ’ s wrong ? __eou__ I got laid off today . __eou__ Oh no ! That ’ s terrible ! __eou__ Yeah . __eou__ What happened ? __eou__ My boss said I didn ’ t have enough skills to do the job well . __eou__ What are you going to do ? __eou__ I ’ m going to start taking classes at the local community college to try to improve my skills . Then I ’ ll start looking for a new position . __eou__
Please switch work shifts with me . __eou__ I would if I could . __eou__ Why can't you ? __eou__ Because I have other obligations . __eou__
Would it be all right if I went home next weekend ? __eou__ For What ? __eou__ Well , I want to surprise my brother showing up for his birthday . __eou__ Well , that sounds like it would be OK . Just be careful . __eou__

I like definite deadlines and I like to meet those deadlines . I expect some deviation from the original plan , but I try to stay focused and not let myself drift too far . I have great attention to detail and like to take my time and do it right the first time . __eou__ Why did you leave your last position ? __eou__ I've set some goals for myself and my career , and unfortunately I'm at a standstill in my current situation .

What kind of job do you think I should get ? __eou__ It all depends on what you want to accomplish in your life . __eou__
Why didn't you sign the contract ? __eou__ Because that company's behavior is not in accordance with international law . __eou__
The numbers in this table don't seem to be in accord with reality . __eou__ I know , but these are the figures that we came up with . __eou__
When should I make my presence known ? __eou__ Wait for my instructions and then proceed accordingly . __eou__
The boss announces the pay raise today , right ? How much do you think we'll get ? __eou__ No idea . Your guess is as good as mine . __eou__ It better be more than last year . __eou__ Well , anything is better than nothing . Wait and see . __eou__
I'm afraid we can't increase salary this year , money is just too title . __eou__ I'm not sure I can't agree , dan __eou__ Why not ? __eou__ Surely , there are other ways to save money . __eou__ What are you talking about , we tried everything ! __eou__

I am glad to have the opportunity of visiting your corporation . I hope we can do business together . __eou__ It's a great pleasure to meet you , Mr . White . I believe you have seen our exhibits in the showroom . What is it that particularly interests you ? __eou__ I am interested in your hardware . I've seen the exhibits and studied your catalogues . I think some of the items will find a ready market in France . Here is a list of requirements . __eou__ Thank you for your inquiry . Would you tell us what quantity you require so that we can work out the offer ? __eou__ I will do that . Meanwhile , could you give me an indication of the price . __eou__ Here are our FOB price lists . All the prices in the lists are subject to our confirmation . __eou__ What about the commission ? From European suppliers , I usually get a 3 to 5 % commission for my imports . It's the general practice . __eou__ As a rule we don't allow any commission . But if the order is sizable one , we will consider it . __eou__ You see I do business on a commission basis . A commission on your prices would make it easier for me to promote sales . Even 2 or 3 % would help . __eou__ We'll discuss this when you place your order with us . __eou__
Hello , Mr . Black , how are you ? __eou__ Fine , thank you , and how are you ? __eou__ Very well , thank you . It's nice to meet you again .

Though we are satisfied with our past trade record , there are still possibilities for more business . In the meantime , let's discuss other spheres of cooperation , such as investment , technology transfer and technical assistance . __eou__

Why this sudden change ? __eou__ It's a long story . In a word , I didn't do a good job of it . I messed up a business deal , a deal that would have made ten million dollars and I messed it up . __eou__ What are you going to do now ? __eou__ I am trying to find a job asap . Lily doesn't know yet . I didn't tell her . I spent the past three days at the coffee shop next to your office , and she thought I went to work as usual . __eou__ That's not the way to solve the problem . Did you look in the classified advertisements column ? __eou__ Yes , I did . But I wasn't qualified for most of the jobs that I was interested in . __eou__ Listen . I will see what I can do , ok ? You go home and tell Lily about this problem you have now . She is your wife and I am sure she will understand . __eou__ I just don't know how to bring it up . Well , all right . She has the right to know anyways . __eou__

But If I don't understand a word or a phrase when you are dictating , can I ask you halfway ? __eou__ No , I ’ d prefer not .

I hope you can give me a definite answer as soon as possible . If I'd turned down , I ll have to secure a position elsewhere . __eou__ All right , then . We'll get in touch with you within a week .

Excuse me , I am Dunlin . I am here about your advertisement for a tourist guide . Are there still any vacancies ? __eou__ Yes . One more is needed . __eou__ Oh , I'm so lucky . I want to apply for it . __eou__ But do you have any experience like that ? __eou__ Yes . I have been a guide for two years . __eou__ OK.Then I want to ask you some questions about the tourist guide.If there wasn accident , for example a tourist falls ill , what would you do ? __eou__ I think I will call the office to send someone to meet us , and escort that person to the nearest hospital without interrupting our trip . __eou__ If one of them forgot a camera in a restaurant , would you let the tourist bus go back ? __eou__ No . In fact , prior to their boarding the bus and their getting off the bus , I will make an announcement to remind them that they should check their belongings . __eou__ Well , it seems that you have all the practical experience to handle these cases . I am very glad to welcome you into our company . __eou__ Thank you . It's my honor . __eou__
This facility is great , don't you think ? __eou__ Yes , it is better than last year . They have done a very good job this time . __eou__ I'm glad our booth is on the first floor . More people can see our display . __eou__ If someone wants to find us , they can look at this floor plan.It shows where all the companies have their booths . __eou__ Let me see that . I didn't get one when I came in . __eou__ Really ? They didn't give you one with your ticket ? __eou__ No . __eou__ That's strange . __eou__ Where do you go for lunch around here ? __eou__ Are you hungry ? __eou__ Not too bad . But I will be soon . __eou__ I went across the street . There is a good Chinese restaurant next to the hotel . __eou__ I can't see Cortex on this floor plan . Don't they have a booth here ? __eou__ They must . Let me look at that.Here it is . Cortex . It's on the second floor , next to the Roll booth . __eou__ Oh , that will be uncomfortable for them . __eou__ For whom ? Cortex ? __eou__ Yes . Cortex just stole Darren McDowell from Rolly.And probably Darren will be here.So he will have to spend the whole show standing next to his old Cortex coworkers . __eou__ I've never met Darren.But you're right . That would probably be uncomfortable . __eou__ When you reserve a booth , you should check who your neighbors will be.Don ' t you think ? __eou__ Yes , maybe . If you're Darren McDowell , you should probably check . __eou__ Yes . Well , I think I'll go get lunch . Will you join me ? __eou__ No , I'll stay here at the booth . I ate earlier . Are you going to the Chinese restaurant ? __eou__ Maybe . I will look around . __eou__
Well , Yuri , tell me about it . __eou__ I'm sorry I can't bring better news , sir . The site is a disaster . __eou__ That's what I was afraid of . __eou__ It is not only the earthquake , sir . But the mudslides.Much of the north half of the site has been covered over by mud . __eou__ Mud ? But Ivan told me there were no mudslides in that district . I thought all the mudslides were down in Chichitango . __eou__ That's what we thought , sir . That's what the news reported.But there was one little mudslide in our district too . Right above our site . __eou__ Oh , that's terrible ! What bad luck ! I wish we had never come to this country.But , if it isn't the strikes and the revolutionaries , it's the earthquakes.Our operations here are finished ! __eou__ I'm sorry , sir . __eou__ It's not your fault , Yuri.But tell me . When will Ivan be able to get out there ? __eou__ Well , it took me about nine hours to get back here by car.If Ivan leaves tonight , I think he should be there by tomorrow lunch . __eou__ Good . I want an estimate of damages as soon as possible . __eou__ But sir ... __eou__ Yes , Yuri ? __eou__ I wouldn't recommend sending Ivan now.Especially not at night . The roads aren't safe . __eou__ Has the earthquake damaged the bridges too ? __eou__ No , sir . The bridges are fine.But I've heard rumors that the revolutionaries are coming down from the mountains.There has been fighting , sir . __eou__ Are you serious ? Fighting ? But I didn't hear anything on the news . __eou__ You know the government controls the press here , sir . They don't want it reported . __eou__ Oh , this is terrible , Yuri . Terrible ! So we can't even assess the damages . How can we do business in this country ? Either we're buried under mud , or we're in danger of getting kidnapped.No , I can't believe this mess ! __eou__ I'm sorry , sir . __eou__ You don't have to keep saying that , Yuri . It's not your fault.But me--I'm the one who should be sorry.It was me who suggested operations here in the first place ! Oh , what can we do ? __eou__
Excuse me , can you tell me which is Bob Rice's office ? __eou__ Sure . It's the third office down this hall . Are you looking for Bob ? __eou__ Yes .

What time did he expect you ? __eou__ He said I should come by this morning . He didn't give me a time.He said I could come any time before noon . __eou__ I see . He's usually here on Tuesday mornings ... __eou__ Today is Tuesday . __eou__ I know . He's usually here , but today he went out to a site on the east side . __eou__ That's too bad . I need to discuss these plans with him . __eou__ Why don't you make an appointment for later in the week ? __eou__ Alright . __eou__ He's here on Tuesdays , Wednesdays and Fridays . What day did you want to see him ? __eou__ Friday is good . __eou__ Morning or afternoon ? __eou__ Morning . __eou__ I can put you down for ten o'clock . Is that alright ? __eou__ Yes . My name is Laura Wills . __eou__ Alright . I have you down for ten AM this Friday . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ You are welcome . __eou__
Come in , Arnold . Have a seat . __eou__ Good morning . __eou__ Would you like something to drink ? __eou__ No , thank you . I just had two cups of coffee at my desk . __eou__ So , you're a serious coffee drinker . __eou__ Yes , it keeps me going . Sometimes I think I'm addicted . __eou__ Well , coffee isn't such a bad thing.Everyone has to have something.For me , it's cigars . Are you a cigar smoker ? __eou__ No , I've tried them . But I'm not really a smoker . __eou__ Well , what would you like to talk to me about ? __eou__ I wanted to set up this meeting with you to discuss a little proposal . __eou__ I'm glad when people have new ideas around here . Tell me about it . __eou__ It is about the staff meetings.You know how we have a staff meeting every Tuesday . __eou__ Yes . __eou__ Well , I have been thinking about it.And I believe we could do things more efficiently here . __eou__ What do you suggest ? __eou__ The way it is now , the staff from all four branches get together once a week.We meet for one hour . But I think a lot of time is wasted in transportation . __eou__ You mean because people have to go across town to get here . __eou__ Yes . Some people spend half of the morning on the road . __eou__ That's true . But our staff meetings are very important , Arnold . I don't know how we can function without them . __eou__ I think they are important too.That ' s why I want people to have a better attitude about them . __eou__ I know a lot of people think the meetings aren't too useful . I'm aware of that . __eou__ Here's what I propose . I think we should meet once every two weeks , but meet for ninety minutes or more . __eou__ Well . __eou__ I also think the meetings should be more focused.And I would be willing to take responsibility for that . __eou__ You mean you want to run the meetings ? __eou__ No , not really run them . But I could help organize them . I could discuss meeting topics with you , and then prepare a schedule for each meeting . I could then send an e-mail to all the staff to explain the coming meeting.This way the meetings would become more focused , and people would prepare better . __eou__ Hmm . But we would meet every two weeks . __eou__ I really think it would work.The meetings could be longer , and better organized . __eou__ I am not against the idea , Arnold.It may really be more efficient , as you say . I'll tell you what we can do.Why don't we try your proposal for a month , and see how it works . __eou__ Excellent . I would be happy to get started on it . __eou__ I will call the managers.Then tomorrow I'll tell you when we can schedule our first meeting in this " new style . " __eou__

I have been learning English for almost 5 years and especially I am fluent at speaking English.Also , I have made some foreigners friends during the experience of learning English . __eou__ That is fine . I think you have the qualifications needed for the job , so I will let you have the job.Does the work schedule suit you ? __eou__ It quite suits me . I am free in the evening these days , I will have no difficulty starting at five pm . __eou__ Good.There is only thing to be settled.Ten RIB an hour is the maximum we can pay you.Is the rate of pay acceptable to you ? __eou__ It seems reasonable.By the way , I can get my earning raised with a excellent performance , can't I ? __eou__ Sure.You will get more if you can invite more customers with your good service . __eou__ I see . I will try my best to do the job well . __eou__ That is good of you to say so.When can you start working ? __eou__ How about next monday ? __eou__ Ok.Let ' s make is next Monday . I n the end , you need to fill out the application form . __eou__ Thank you for your kindness , ma'am . See you next Monday . __eou__

What type of people do you work with most effectively ? __eou__ I tend to work well with people who are confident and straightforward.It ' s more difficult for me to be around timid people , because I move quickly and I am decisive . __eou__ What things impress you in your colleagues ? __eou__ I admire and work best with people who are of good character and integrity . I also think confidence and enthusiasm is positive in any business environment . __eou__ What are some of the things your supervisor did that you disliked ? __eou__ The only thing I really don't like is to get feedback in front of others . I want to hear good and bad feedback in private , so that I have time to think and react to the issue without other distractions . I believe that's the fair way to improve learning or to change future behavior . __eou__ How do you organize and plan for major projects ? __eou__ I love to brainstorm a best , worst , and most likely scenario.Then , I set a timetable that's realistic.What I usually find is that some combination of my schedule easily as these things unfold because I've already visualized what could happen and how I'd react . __eou__ Describe an experience when you had to work under great pressure . __eou__ I had to complete an end of quarter report once while I was on the road for two consecutive weeks.The amount of telephoning back and forth was incredible , because I could't bring my office files with me.Luckily I had a great secretary and a logical filling system , so we located everything we needed . __eou__ How do you manage your time in a typical day ? __eou__ I've always given priority to work with established clients , because they offer a better risk / return value.The last thing I do is general correspondence , especially internal correspondence , which I take care of at the end of the day or week . __eou__ Describe a time when you acted on someone's suggestion . __eou__ I changed my open office hours because several of my employees found it difficult to visit me except in the early mornings . __eou__
Susan , Is the manager in this office ? __eou__ Yes . But he is meeting a client . __eou__ Oh , that's too bad . I just got a phone call saying that my wife is now in the hospital . She is going to deliver a baby . I must take the day off to go to the hospital . May I talk to him to ask for leave ? __eou__ I am afraid not , but I think I could convey your leave to him after the client goes . __eou__ Oh , that's very kind of you . Thank you very much . I've got to go . __eou__

You are my secretary and you are not supposed to talk to me in that tone of voice . Do you know that ? __eou__ What do you expect ? I've been working for you for three years , and you've never given me a holiday . I don't feel well today , because I have a terrible headache . I am not in the mood for being gentle and polite . If you can't stand it , it's your problem . I am not going to change , because I think it suits you best . __eou__ Keep your voice down , Kate . I know you've had a hard day today , but you should at least show some respect for me . If you really don't feel well , go home . There isn't much work today anyway . __eou__ I apologize for forgetting myself , but I do need some time off . __eou__

David , I am going for an interview tomorrow . It's an American company . Can you give me an idea of what the interviewer will ask ? __eou__ Well . They may ask you to tell them more about your educational background and your working background . __eou__ But they can see my resume . It's all in there . __eou__ I know , but sometimes interviewers just want to hear you say it . Then you may be asked for your viewpoint on why you feel you are qualified for the job , give them all your qualifications and how you think they will fit the position you are applying for . Questions like what sort of experience do you have and what are your goals ? are closely related to this . __eou__ Ok . What else ? __eou__ They may want to know how the company will benefit and why they should hire you ? __eou__ I see . What about the salary ? __eou__ Hm , they may ask you what kind of salary you have in mind , or simply tell you what the company is offering . I think the latter is more likely for a starting position , especially if you have little experience . And if they are seriously considering hiring you , they will probably want to know when you would be available to start work . And basically , that's about it . __eou__ Ok , thanks , David . You ’ Ve helped me a lot . __eou__ Anytime . Let me know how it works out . __eou__
Anything else ? __eou__ Yes , one last thing . How much holiday time do you give your employees every year ? __eou__ Our employees receive 15 days of paid vacation every year .

Thanks so much for your time . __eou__ We'll contact you soon , Tom . Thanks for coming in . __eou__
So how was your interview ? __eou__ I haven't gone to the interview yet . It's tomorrow . I am so nervous . __eou__ Don't worry . You should do fine .

You've got to show them how easy-going and personable you are . __eou__ Thanks , I'll keep that in mind . __eou__

Todd , but Mr . Emory felt that it was going too slowly , and that it needed a fresh start . He should have told you . __eou__

I called yesterday and she was there . __eou__ I'm sure you have the wrong number . This one has been my number for more than 20 years . __eou__ That's impossible . I remember the number clearly .

I will make my reservations as necessary . __eou__ Just make sure to turn in all the necessary paperwork to ensure there are no problems with the days you want to take off . __eou__
I've read your report , and I'm not sure I agree with you.You think you can get attendance improved by requiring salaried employees to take their all of their sick days ? __eou__ That's right . I know it must sound crazy to you , but we believe there will be fewer absences this way . __eou__ We give them 10 or 15 sick days per year . Surely requiring people to take them couldn't possibly help . It sounds like a counter - productive policy change to me . __eou__ Right now , we have incentives encouraging employees to come to work as often as possible.But employees with colds and the flu are coming to work and infecting their colleagues . __eou__ I see . So our current policies are encouraging sick people to come to work , resulting in more sick employees . __eou__ That's right . If sick days were mandatory , sick people would stay home . We wouldn't have these company-wide epidemics . __eou__ Let's give it a shot ! __eou__
Would you consider an offer of $ 56,000 per year ? __eou__ What kind of benefits are we talking about ? __eou__ Our standard package includes health insurance , two weeks vacation and a company car . __eou__ Are these things negotiable ? __eou__ Uh ... not normally . What do you have in mind ? __eou__ Vacation time is important to me . I would be willing to give up these other items in order to receive more vacation days . __eou__ What an interesting idea , Ms . Wilson . Would you also be willing to accept a cut in initial salary ? __eou__ Possibly . What do you have in mind ? __eou__
I ’ m so sorry to call you on such short notice , but something ’ s come up . __eou__ You mean for this afternoon ’ s meeting ? __eou__ That ’ s right I ’ m afraid I have to postpone it . Mr . Scott got sick and I have to attend the Speechmaker ’ s Symposium in his place . I ’ m leaving today , and I won ’ t be back until a week from Friday . __eou__ That ’ s quite a while . Let ’ s make it the week after you get back , then . __eou__ That will be great . So it ’ s two weeks from tomorrow , same time and place . I ’ m really sorry to do this to you . __eou__ No problem at all . To tell you the truth , I could use the extra time in my schedule to catch up on some paperwork . __eou__
From reviewing your resume I can see that you have ample experience for this position.What I want to know is why you think you ’ re right for the job . __eou__ Well I ’ m impressed with what the company has done in the past and I think by hiring me the company ’ s future can only be brighter . I find that my personal goals and ideas about business operation __eou__ So you ’ Ve acquainted yourself with the company . It ’ s refreshing to interview someone who ’ s sure of what they want . __eou__ Yes , I believe that it ’ s crucial for me to know if a company is right for me , not just if I ’ m right for the company . I ’ Ve only been impressed by what I ’ Ve read and heard and I see myself having __eou__ Commitment to the company and the team is very important to us here . __eou__ Well I ’ m definitely a team player as well as being highly self-motivated . I believe this company can fulfill my long-term goals and offer me great upward mobility . Therefore you will find in me __eou__
I really think if I can get my foot in the door at this company it will do wonders for my career . Do you think you can help me polish my interview style ? __eou__ Sure . Doing your homework and preparing for an interview really pays off . __eou__ I ’ Ve researched the company and think I ’ m perfect for the job but I ’ m not sure how to get it across to them . __eou__ Well first you have to have more confidence.Employers look for people who are interested , enthusiastic and sure of themselves . __eou__ I know I have what it takes but Im worried that my work experience won ’ t sufficient . Should I inflate my experience ? __eou__ No , you should always be upfront and honest about your weaknesses . However by focusing on your strong points and maintaining a positive attitude about your abilities , you can take the attention __eou__
I ’ Ve just looked over your resume and I must admit I am quite impressed . __eou__ Thank you . I ’ Ve worked pretty hard to be able to list those accomplishments . __eou__ You ’ Ve got plenty of training and experience . I wonder if you could tell me something about your goals . Where do you see yourself ten years from now ? __eou__ To be honest , I don ’ t plan in that much detail . My goals tend to be general ; I define success according to the job at hand . I see myself advancing as I succeed , but I don ’ t necessarily dwell on __eou__ interesting ! And how do you feel about decision-making ? Are you an independent thinker , or do you depend more on your superior for direction ? __eou__ That depends a bit on the problem at hand . There are certain situations in which a manager can give a general directive , and expect his employees to know how to take the initiative on the detail __eou__ Sounds good . Everyone is taking about teams these days . Can you describe your role as a member of a sales team ? __eou__ I see myself as an encourager . Of course , sales can be quite competitive and sometimes people in this field have a secret desire for others to fail . In my last job , each representative handled __eou__ So , your experience is as impressive in practice as it is on paper . __eou__
Thank you for agreeing to come in and meet with us today . __eou__ Thank you for inviting me . __eou__ I can see from your resume you were in charge of sales for Corporate World Unlimited from 1997 to 1999 . Can you please tell me about your responsibilities ? __eou__ Yes . I was in charge of profit and loss for the northwest region of Canada . As a manager , I was directly responsible for a 50 % increase in sales over a four-month period . __eou__ What , do you believe , are some of the key attributes that helped you to achieve such an outstanding increase in sales ? __eou__ I believe persistence and perseverance are key attributes . __eou__
I can ’ t attend the meeting in Washington . I ’ Ve proposed you as the most able substitute . __eou__ But I ’ Ve never been on a business trip before ! __eou__ It ’ s easy enough . Just make sure you keep track of all your expenses . The accounting department will reimburse you for all your meals and travel expenses . __eou__ So the company will pay for everything ? __eou__ Yes , but when you send in your expense report , you also have to file a report summarizing your trip . It ’ s not just a big vacation , you know . __eou__ That sounds good . But what do you want me to do there ? __eou__ I ’ Ve already paved the way . You just have to give a presentation on what our products are . I will do the follow-up and close the sale . __eou__
Comfort Inn , may I help you ? __eou__ I ’ m looking for a hotel near the convention center . __eou__ You ’ re in luck ! We ’ re just a two-minute drive from there . Would you like to make a reservation ? __eou__ Not just yet . I have one or two questions . How much for a single ? __eou__ During the peak season , a single room goes for 50 dollars on a night . But we ’ Ve got a Single Super Saver Special going on right now – only $ 30 a night . And we ’ Ve also extended our checkout time 00 in __eou__ That ’ s a good deal . Since this is a working trip , I wonder if you have meeting rooms where I can get together with some clients . __eou__ Yes , we have five meeting rooms , of various sizes . We can accommodate large meetings and small , informal gatherings as well . Of course , if you have many small meeting , you might consider checking __eou__ That sounds great . Do you accept checks ? __eou__ I ’ m sorry , sir , we don ’ t . But we do accept all major credit cards . __eou__
Looking through your C . V . , I see that you graduated from Oklahoma State University . Can you tell me what training you have had that would specifically relate to the cable television Industry ? __eou__ Well , I ’ Ve attended some conferences in this field . But the most relevant training I ’ Ve had was in computer design . I believe I could integrate that knowledge with my college degree to design __eou__ I see . Did you have anything specific in mind ? __eou__ Well , I notice that you currently provide an on-screen TV Guide . At the moment , it just scrolls the names of the programs in a repeated loop . If you have many channels , you have to wait a long t __eou__ That ’ s impressive . How would you make that pay ? __eou__ Tie it in with the pay-per-view services , and perhaps it could be a money-maker . __eou__ I see you have several good ideas . Now , I just have a few questions about your C . V . I notice that there is a five-year gap between your last job and now . __eou__ Yes , I took a break from work during that time . I had a baby , and as she was born with a handicap , I decided to suspend my career . But I have continued to keep up with the Industry through con __eou__ So , you ’ re just starting back . Maybe you ’ d better tell me a little more about your experience . __eou__
Did you pack this bag yourself ? Has it been out of your possession at any time before checking-in ? __eou__ Yes , I packed it myself , and it hasn ’ t been out of my possession . __eou__ Are you bringing in any plants or animal products ? __eou__ No . __eou__ Our sniffer dog seems to disagree . Do you mind if we look in your suitcase ? __eou__ Not at all . Go right ahead . __eou__ What ’ s this sir ? __eou__ It ’ s traditional Chinese Medicine . I mix it with hot water like tea . Sorry . I forgot about it . __eou__ What are these red things sir ? __eou__ Oh no ! I forgot about those too ! Those are Chinese sausages for my Aunt Lily . __eou__ I ’ m sorry sir , but you can ’ t take any of this into the country . We will also have to check your carry-on . Please step this way . Don ’ t ’ be nervous ; we ’ ll just look through it briefly and then __eou__
Can you tell me a little bit about yourself ? __eou__ I am a graduate of a technical university and have been employed as a technician with Company or approximately 10 years . __eou__ Please explain why you are interested in leaving your current position and please elaborate on your technical skills . __eou__ I am looking for a growth opportunity , which I feel is not available at my current employer . In terms of skills , I am Microsoft certified in Windows XP and several other operating system __eou__ Where do you see yourself five years from now ? __eou__ I see myself in a management position . __eou__
Good evening , sir . Welcome to the Comfort Inn . __eou__ Hello . I have a reservation , under the name Lee , Leo Lee . __eou__ Mmmm . I ’ m not sure if we have you down here . How do you spell your last name ? __eou__ It ’ s L-e-e . __eou__ Oh , right . You ’ re in our system . I was just looking under Li . So , we ’ Ve got you down for a Business Suite for three days . If I could just have your credit card , I ’ ll process your check-in while __eou__ You mean I have to pay now ? __eou__ Oh no , we just make an impression of your card using our credit card machine . It ’ s in lieu of a deposit . If everything is OK when you check out , we give it back to you then . It ’ s pretty sta __eou__ I see . I guess you can tell I don ’ t travel much . __eou__ ( later ) Here ’ s your card , sir . You ’ re all checked in . let me just tell you about a few of our services . We have free breakfast in the lounge from 7:00- 9:00 . You call the receptionist to arrange __eou__
Good evening , Mr . Lee and thank you for choosing our airline . We have just discovered that this flight is overbooked . Would you like to volunteer to give up your seat ? __eou__ Overbooked ? Give up my seat ? I don ’ t understand . __eou__ From time to time we have a situation in which there are more passengers than there are seats on the aircraft . That ’ s overbooked . __eou__ I know what overbooked is , I just don ’ t understand how that could happen ? __eou__ Actually it ’ s a common practice to overbook , as passengers often don ’ t take their flight as scheduled . Most of the time there is no problem but today , more passengers arrived than we have seats , __eou__ So who has to stay behind ? __eou__ Well , first we ask for volunteers . If someone like yourself volunteers , they receive a free round trip ticket to be used within one year . If no one volunteers we just have to select someone . __eou__ Ok . I ’ ll volunteer . I could use a free ticket ! __eou__
I ’ m ready to settle the bill . __eou__ I hope you enjoyed your stay . __eou__ Definitely ! Very relaxing . __eou__ Good . Right , that comes to $ 1,500 . __eou__ What ? I only stayed three nights . __eou__ That ’ s right , sir . Three nights at 500 dollars a night ... that comes to $ 1,500 . __eou__ But your brochure said that this was a package deal and the hotel ’ s services were all-inclusive . __eou__ Yes , of course . The meals and excursions were included in the hotel price . __eou__ But why are you overcharging me almost a thousand dollars ? 250 dollars a night , times three nights should just be $ 750 . __eou__ I ’ m sorry sir . The 250 - dollar rate is based on double occupancy . That means it ’ s 250 per person . The room itself is 500 dollars a night . __eou__ Perhaps I could talk to your manager ? __eou__ Of course . Just a minute ; I ’ ll get her . __eou__
Mr . Lee , all ready to check out ? We ’ Ve already prepared your bill , and housekeeping has done a quick check of the room . How will you be paying ? __eou__ I ’ d like to use my Master Card , if I could . Hey , wait a minute ! This is a bit more than I expected . Why is it so high ? __eou__ The bill is itemized , so take some time to look through it and make sure we ’ Ve charged you for the correct services . Most of your extra charges were for phone calls and room service . __eou__ What ’ s this here – “ house stock ” ? __eou__ That ’ s the mini-bar . Each day we check what ’ s missing and restock it . The items you consume are put on your bill . __eou__ I had no idea – and look at these charges for movies ! __eou__ Those are for pay-per-view movies . Each time you selected a movie , the entertainment system prompted you to confirm that you really wanted it , right ? __eou__ Yes , that ’ s right . But I had no idea I would be charged for all this . Thank goodness my company will let me reimburse all this . __eou__
I want some envelopes please . __eou__ Do you want the large size , or the small size ? __eou__ The large size please . Do Have you any writing-paper ? __eou__ Yes , we do . I don't have any small pads . I only have large ones . Do you want a pad ? __eou__ Yes , please . And I want some glue . __eou__ A bottle of glue . __eou__ And I want a large box of chalk , too . __eou__ I only have small boxes . Do you want one ? __eou__ No , thank you . __eou__ Is that all ? __eou__ That's all , thank you . __eou__ What else do you want ? __eou__ I want my change . __eou__
Accounting , this is Mike . __eou__ Mike , this is Leo in Sales . I was just calling to confirm our meeting tomorrow.Are we still on ? __eou__ Goodness ! It ’ s been so long I actually forgot . Let me see ... yes , it is on my calendar . __eou__ OK . See you at your office at 2:30 . __eou__ Right , see you then ! __eou__
Hey there ! I ’ Ve been hoping to run into you . Are you busy tomorrow morning ? __eou__ Let me see ... Wednesday morning . Yes , I am booked solid all morning . What ’ s up ? __eou__ I was hoping to talk to you about the sales projections for next year . I ’ m having a little trouble figuring out how to use the spreadsheet you set up for me . It has a lot of complicated form __eou__ I can explain them to you . It ’ ll just take about a half an hour . How about Friday afternoon ? __eou__ Ooh . Sorry , that ’ s not good for me . I am tied up all day Friday . We ’ ll have to do it next week . I am wide open then . __eou__ OK . Shall we say next week , on Tuesday at 2:30 ? __eou__ Sure , that ’ ll be fine for me . I ’ ll come to your office so you can show how you set up these macros . __eou__
Good afternoon , Mr . Dome ’ s office . __eou__ This is Denise , Mr . Bruce ’ s Secretary . I was calling to confirm his meeting tomorrow with Mr . Dome at 4 o ’ clock . __eou__ Yes , it ’ s confirmed for here in our office . __eou__ Is your address still 1150 Lake Road ? __eou__ Yes , that ’ s correct . __eou__ Ok . Thank you . __eou__
Hi Ron , this is Kim at headquarters . __eou__ Oh , hi Kim . How ’ s it going ? __eou__ Great , thanks . I was calling to change our meeting next week . __eou__ Ok , sure . When did you have in mind ? __eou__ Well , I was hoping we could reschedule for early next month , Our trip has been postponed until the 2nd . __eou__ Why don ’ t ’ we say the 3rd around 2:00 p . m . ? __eou__ That works for me ! I will call you when I get into town to reconfirm . __eou__ Great . Talk to you then . __eou__
Hi . I ’ m here to catch flight 513 to New York . __eou__ May I see your ticket please ? __eou__ Here you are . Do you need to see my passport ? __eou__ Any form of picture I . D . will do . __eou__ Mmmm ... a photo I . D . I have my New Jersey driver ’ s license . Is that ok ? __eou__ That will do . What an interesting picture ! How old is it ? __eou__ Actually it wad taken just last year , but I had a shaved head and a beard . Can you still recognize me ? __eou__ Barely . Will you be checking any luggage today ? __eou__ Yes , One suitcase . I also have a carry-on bag . __eou__ Ok . Mr . Lee , you ’ re all set . Your flight leaves from gate 10 . Boarding begins at 10:30 __eou__
Hi I came in on flight 513 . Everyone else took their luggage off the conveyor belt , but mine didn ’ t seem to be there . __eou__ Let me check the computer . Uh-oh , Looks like your luggage is on its way to Paris . __eou__ You ’ re kidding . What am I going to do ? __eou__ Well , we can give you this lovely shaving kit and call you the minute your luggage arrives here . Just leave us a contact number . __eou__ You can reach me at 13661306917 . __eou__ Thank you . I am terribly sorry about this . It very rarely happens . We do have a sophisticated tracking system , so I know we will find it soon . But we apologize for the inconvenience . __eou__ That ’ s ok . There wasn ’ t anything important in there anyway . The shaving kit more than makes up for my lost luggage . __eou__ Wow ! I have been working here for 15 years and you ’ re the first person to accept a lost luggage situation cheerfully . __eou__ I ’ Ve had a lot worse problems than this traveling so it ’ s really no big deal . __eou__
I would like to buy a ticket to New York please . __eou__ When do you plan to travel ? __eou__ I ’ d like to pack my bags and leave tonight . __eou__ Are you aware that without two weeks advance notice prices will be very high ? __eou__ Yes I know , but I just got the chance to leave and so I am going to take it no matter what . __eou__ I understand . So that ’ s one ticket to New York , and you ’ ll be departing tonight . Will that be one-way or round trip ? __eou__ I wish I could stay there , but unfortunately it will have to be a round trip ticket . __eou__ When would you like to return ? __eou__ My return date will be the 14th . __eou__ OK . I have several seats available . Would you like a window seat or an aisle seat ? __eou__ Anything but a center seat is fine with me . The middle seat drives me crazy ! __eou__ OK Mr . Lee . I have you booked on flight 513 leaving on the 5th at 11:00 pm and arriving in New York on the 6th at 6 __eou__ Will there be any layovers ? __eou__ No , all flights are direct . __eou__ Perfect ! I ’ m afraid to ask , but how much is it ? __eou__ $ 800 dollars . __eou__
Hi . I ’ m here for flight 514 returning to Beijing but the board shows there is a delay.How long of a delay is expected ? __eou__ So far it looks like we will be leaving two hours late , but keep checking the departing flights status board just in case . __eou__ Do you think it ’ s safe to leave to get a quick bite ? __eou__ I think you should stay in the airport . Even though the delay is expected to be two hours , the flight departure could be announced any minute . Who knows ? __eou__ What seems to be the problem ? __eou__ It seems there are some loose bolts on one of the wings . It happens all the time . No need to worry . __eou__ Umm ... You know ... Actually I was thinking of trying another airline . No need to hold my seat . __eou__
Good morning . Please come into my office . __eou__ Good morning . Thank you . __eou__ I see that you have some impressive writing experience . __eou__ Yes . I have written for several top newspapers in the country . I ’ m also in the process of writing my first novel . __eou__ Wonderful . I ’ d like to know why you ’ re interested in this position at our paper . __eou__
Hi . I ’ m here for flight 513 to New York but I thought I heard the paging system announce that it is canceled . Is that true ? __eou__ I ’ m terribly sorry , sir , but I ’ m afraid it is true . That flight has been canceled . Would you like to try to book tomorrow ’ s flight ? __eou__ No way ! I worked very hard so that I could leave on today ’ s flight . Are there seats on another airline ? __eou__ It ’ s possible . If you would like to book with another airline the line is right over there . __eou__ You mean the line over there of about 200 people ? ! __eou__ That ’ s the one . It seems that everyone is anxious to get to New York tonight . __eou__ This is a rotten way to start a vacation . I HATE lines ! Can you book me on tomorrow ’ s flight ? __eou__ Certainly . You will also be receiving a 50 % discount as our way of apologizing for the inconvenience . __eou__
We need to call an emergency meeting as soon as possible about this . __eou__ OK . Let me send a memo around . __eou__ Schedule it for this afternoon , when Ken gets back . __eou__ I don ’ t think he ’ s back today . __eou__ Oh , that ’ s right . Go ahead anyways . I ’ ll fill him in . We can ’ t lose this order under any circumstances ! __eou__ I know , it ’ s a big one . __eou__
Well , what did you think about the last candidate ? Do you think we should hire her ? __eou__ She had a very impressive resume , but she seemed to lack the confidence that I think a good manager needs . __eou__ What made you think that she wasn't very confident ? __eou__ Did you notice the way that she avoided making eye contact with us while she talked ? __eou__ She was a bit nervous , I guess . What else ? __eou__ When she first walked into the room to greet us , she didn't shake our hands or introduce herself at all . I thought that was a bit unprofessional . __eou__ you're right . If she walked into meetings with our clients like that , it would make our company look bad , wouldn't it ? __eou__ It sure would . Did you also notice the way she slouched in her chair during most of the interview ? She had horrible posture ! __eou__ I agree . I guess I was paying more attention to her answers than her body language . __eou__ On top fo all of that , she didn't seem to have any sense about people's personal space . she didn't keep enough distance between us when during the meeting . __eou__ That's true . I guess we'll have to keep looking for a manager then . __eou__ Don't worry , we'll find someone eventually ! __eou__
Hello , Parker . How ’ s everything ? __eou__ Can ’ t complain . And you ? __eou__ Business is booming . I understand you want to meet up with me next week . How ’ s your schedule looking ? __eou__ Let me see . I can come out and see you first thing Wednesday . __eou__ Great . __eou__
Do you mind if I smoke here ? __eou__ Yes , I do . I ’ d prefer you didn ’ t . The AC ( air-conditioning ) is also on . __eou__ Can I just turn off the AC for now and open the window and smoke indoors ? __eou__ That ’ s not a very good idea . It ’ s quite hot outside . Why don ’ t you smoke outside ? __eou__ It ’ s very hot and that ’ s why I ’ d like to smoke inside . __eou__ Though the AC has the air-purifying function . I ’ d still rather have fresh air than smoke . Are you okay with that ? __eou__ Oh , no problem . __eou__
have you finished going through the contract ? __eou__ yes , but I have a few questions for you . __eou__ Ok . Ask away . __eou__ first , I ’ d like to know if you offer employees sick leave . __eou__ yes , employees can take up to 10 days of sick leave per year . However , in order to get paid , you ’ ll have to bring in a note from the doctor ’ s . __eou__ even if I ’ m only sick for one day ? __eou__ that ’ s correct . __eou__ that ’ s pretty strict , if you ask me . __eou__ well , we ’ Ve had to add that to the contract because we found that many of our employees were taking almost one sick day a month , even though they weren ’ t sick . __eou__ I see . I guess that makes sense . __eou__ do you have any other questions ? __eou__ yes . Maternity leave is mentioned in the contract , but there ’ s nothing in the contract alout paternity leave . Do you offer anything to fathers ? __eou__ we do actually . We can add that as an amendment to your contract . __eou__ how many days of paternity leave do you offer ? __eou__ men are allowed to take 10 days of paternity leave for their first child . __eou__ why are women allowed so much more time for maternity leave ? __eou__ well , women are the ones giving birth . I think it ’ s fair to give them more time , don ’ t you ? __eou__ I guess so . I don ’ t have any other questions . Should I sign here then ? __eou__ yes , please . __eou__
do you have a minute ? __eou__ sure , what would you like to discuss ? __eou__ I've made a tough decision , sir . Here's my resignation . __eou__ well , I have to tell you that I'm quite surprised . Is there any possible way to change your mind ? __eou__ I'm afraid not , sir . I've made up my mind . It's something I have to do . __eou__ can I ask why ? Were you unhappy working for us ? __eou__ oh , no . not at all . __eou__ are you planning on studying abroad ? __eou__ no , sir . __eou__ have you been given a better offer ? __eou__ Oh , no . I would never look for another job while working here . I think this is a fantastic place to work . __eou__ well , what's the problem then ? __eou__ it's my mother . She's sick and needs someone to take care of her . I'm the only one who can do it . __eou__ I'm sorry to hear that , but you don't need to quit over that . Why don't you just take a leave of absence ? We can hold your job for you until your mother gets better . __eou__ really ? I didn't know that would be possible . __eou__ sure , we'd be carry to lose a good worker like you . __eou__ thanks , sir . __eou__
how was your day ? __eou__ let ’ s start with you . How was yours ? __eou__ it was really busy . I had to work straight through my lunch break . __eou__ did you get to leave early then ? __eou__ my boss told me that I could either go home early or take a long lunch break another day , so I decided to wait and take a long lunch break another time . __eou__ it was nice of your boss to give you an option . My boss would never do that . __eou__ let ’ s get back to you . How was your day ? __eou__ it was horrible ! It was just one thing after another . __eou__ you look pretty upset . Are you ok ? __eou__ I ’ m fine . But I have bad news . __eou__ what ’ s that ? __eou__ I got sacked today . __eou__ you ’ re kidding ! How did that happen ? __eou__ well , I was late to work today . It was the third time I was late this week . __eou__ how late were you ? __eou__ only about 5 minutes . __eou__ you got fired for being a few minutes late ? __eou__ my boss is really picky about that . He never arrives late , usually works over-time , and always gets his work done on time . __eou__ oh well . You never really liked your boss anyway , did you ? __eou__
Are you ready for your big interview tomorrow ? __eou__ What ’ s to get ready ? __eou__ Lots ! Have you done any research about the company ? __eou__ Nope . __eou__ Have you updated your CV ? __eou__ Nope . __eou__
Amelia , could you spare a few minutes ? __eou__ sure . What do you need ? __eou__ well , I wanted to let you know that I've put in my notice . __eou__ really ? Why ? __eou__ it's complicated . But basically it boils down to one thing . This company is downsizing and I can't continue working for a company that may let me go . __eou__ but surely they won't fire you ! You're one of the most experienced managers here ! __eou__ well , to be honest , there's another reason . I've got a better offer . __eou__ well that's great news ! Congratulations ! Where will you be located ? __eou__ the head office is in New York , but I'll be dealing with overseas companies and flying to this side of the world from time to time . __eou__ it'll be sad to see you go , but it sounds like you're found yourself a great opportunity . __eou__ I have . I feel lucky . I look forward to dealing with overseas companies and at the same time having a chance to use English more . __eou__ I'm sorry to bring this up , but would it be possible for you to write me a letter of recommendation before you go ? __eou__ of course I can . In fact , if there are other job opportunities at this new company , I'll recommend you personally . __eou__ thanks . I appreciate that . __eou__
are you ready for the meeting ? __eou__ yes , come on in . how's your new job going ? __eou__ it's challenging , but I'm enjoying it quite a bit . __eou__ that's great . I knew you'd do a good job as a manager . __eou__ thanks a lot . __eou__ how's your assistant manager getting on ? __eou__ well , that's part of the problem . His probation period is up tomorrow and I don't think he's ready to pass . __eou__ what seems to be the problem ? __eou__ well , he was supposed to be able to learn his job in 30 days , but he just doesn't seem to know what he's doing . __eou__ if you gave him another 30 days , do you think he could figure it out by then ? __eou__ to be honest , he has no authority . He's a hard-worker , but no one listens to him . __eou__ I see . Not everyone is cut out to work in management . __eou__ I know . It'd be great if we could transfer him to a department where he doesn't have to work with people . __eou__ there's an opening in the creative design department . It involves working with computers . __eou__ that's perfect . I'll let him know tomorrow . Thanks ! __eou__
hello ? __eou__ good morning , Nathaniel . This is Leah calling from the International Student Office . __eou__ good morning . __eou__ the reason I'm calling is because Ms . Collins will not be able to call you back until next week . __eou__ oh . I had hoped she would have called me back yesterday . __eou__ she's terribly sorry about that . She had to leave the office suddenly and won't be able to return until next week . She hopes you understand . __eou__ is there someone else I can talk to ? __eou__ she asked me to call you to book an appointment with someone else today . When are you free today ? __eou__ any time after 2 pm today would be good for me . __eou__ Mr . Liu is available at 2:15 today . Will that work for you ? __eou__ I'd prefer to speak with Ms . Fonda . __eou__ I'm afraid she isn't available this afternoon . She has an opening at 11:30 this morning . Will that work for you ? __eou__ that will be fine . __eou__ ok , we'll be expecting you at 11:30 . See you then . __eou__
hi , Isaiah . How are you ? __eou__ I ’ m well . And you ? __eou__ fine . How ’ s your job going ? __eou__ I don ’ t know if I told you or not , but I decided to start my own business . __eou__ really ? That ’ s fantastic . What kind of business is it ? __eou__ I ’ Ve started an investment banking firm with some of my old colleagues from Goldman Sachs . __eou__ how ’ s it going ? __eou__ it started off a bit slow , but now , business is really booming ! __eou__ that ’ s such great news . I ’ m really happy for you ! Where is your office located ? __eou__ our headoffice is here in Beijing , but we ’ re planning on opening up two more offices soon . __eou__ where will those be located ? __eou__ if all goes well , we ’ ll open one up in Hong Kong in April and another one in Singapore in October . __eou__ when will you find out ? __eou__ we ’ re negotiating the final details of the leasing contracts tomorrow . __eou__ well , good luck . I hope it all goes well for you tomorrow ! __eou__ thanks ! __eou__
how's your new job going ? __eou__ really well , thanks . __eou__ how are you finding your new boss ? __eou__ she's not bad . She's a bit bossy , but I'm sure I'll get used to her . __eou__ would you rather have her or your old boss back ? __eou__ she's far better than my old boss . He didn't know how to express his opinion without putting at least one other person down . __eou__ how about your new co-workers ? __eou__ they are all pretty easy-going . It's a very friendly place to work . __eou__ do you miss your old co-workers ? __eou__ of course . I spent so much time at my old workplace that I got to know them all very well . They were like family to me . __eou__ do people in different departments get along with each other ? __eou__ sure . Since we work together in teams , we have to get along with each other . __eou__ do you like working in teams with people from different departments ? __eou__ yes , it helps everyone to understand what we're doing from different perspectives . __eou__ do you like working in teams ? __eou__ I prefer it to working independently . I think most people do . __eou__
how's your job search going ? __eou__ I don't know . I only started looking for a job a few days ago . __eou__ I see . Have you found anything that you're interested in ? __eou__ I've only found a few openings in my field . __eou__ what kind of job are you looking for ? __eou__ I'm trying to find a job in sound engineering . __eou__ there's not a very high demand for that kind of job , is there ? __eou__ unfortunately not . If I can't find anything in the field , then I could also work in the tourism field . __eou__ that's a good idea . You have plenty of experience in the tourism industry , don't you ? __eou__ yes . __eou__ by the way , I saw a job in the paper this morning that you might be interested in . __eou__ really ? what is it ? __eou__ it's a job at a recruitment agency . __eou__ that's interesting . Do you think they'd hire me ? __eou__ well , you have plenty of experience job hunting . I think you'd be the perfect person for the job ! __eou__ that's true . I might as well call them up and see if I can get an interview . Do you have the details ? __eou__ sure , it's the ad circled with a red pen in the middle of the classifieds . Good luck ! __eou__
I don ’ t know what I ’ m going to do ! It ’ s going to be impossible to make ends meet if I lose my job ! __eou__ don ’ t worry . I don't think you ’ re going to lose your job over one mistake . __eou__ it was a rather big mistake . When you work as an investment adviser , ONC small mistake can cost the company millions . __eou__ but it wasn ’ t just you who was involved , right ? You were only doing what your supervisor told you to do . __eou__ that ’ s true , but my supervisor is very dishonest . There ’ s no reason he needs to tell our boss the truth . I ’ m sure he will tell our boss that it was all my fault , and there ’ s nothing I can do about tha __eou__ let ’ s think realistically about what might happen . How much money do you have in your savings ? __eou__ I have enough to live off of for about 3 months . But I really don't want to spend my life savings on just living ! I ’ d rather invest my money somehow . __eou__ well , that ’ s good . If you lose your job , you can just move in with me until you find another job . That will save you plenty of money . __eou__ that ’ s very generous of you . I guess that would work . __eou__ if you lose your job , you just have to go for a few months without buying all the junk you usually buy . If you live frugally , you ’ ll save plenty of money . __eou__ I guess working with so much money has made me rather greedy . Maybe losing my job would be a good thing ! __eou__
Hi , Jane . How are you doing this morning ? __eou__ I ’ m all right , thanks . Just a little tired . __eou__ Late night ? __eou__ Yeah , I got home around two . __eou__
Hi there ! My name ’ s Terry Graham . You ’ re new around here , huh ? __eou__ Yes . My name ’ s Mark Benson . I just started a couple of weeks ago . __eou__ Well , if there ’ s anything I can do for you , let me know . __eou__ Thanks , I appreciate that ! __eou__
hi , my name's Abby . What's your name ? __eou__ I'm colin . It's nice to meet you . What do you do ? __eou__ I'm a freelance English teacher . How about you ? __eou__ I'm in between jobs at the moment . __eou__ what kind of job are you looking for ? __eou__ I'd like to find a job with flexible hours in the IT field . __eou__ have you ever thought about becoming a freelance IT consultant ? __eou__ no . Is it difficult to find such a job ? __eou__ not if you are good at net-working . Do you like to meet new people ? __eou__ yes . I'm pretty out-going and friendly . __eou__ do you have experience in the IT field ? __eou__ I have some . I worked in the IT department at a language school for four years in Spain . __eou__ do you speak Spanish ? __eou__ yes , but not fluently . __eou__ that's OK . Have you sent your CV out to anyone yet ? __eou__ I've sent my CV to dozens of companies but nobody has got back to me . __eou__ did you write a clear objective in your resume ? __eou__ no , because I didn't know what I wanted to do . __eou__ I think you need to update your CV . Bring it over to my office tomorrow and I'll help you with it . __eou__ thanks , I will . I'll see you tomorrow then ! __eou__
hi , Betty.what ' s up ? __eou__ nothing special . how about you ? Are you used to the life here in the States ? __eou__ everything has been fine for the past several months . __eou__ great ! __eou__ well , I wish someone could talk to me about Western table manners __eou__ sounds interesting . Where did you get the idea ? __eou__ as you know , table manners in China are quite different from those of Westerners . __eou__ absolutely . that's because both of us have distinctive cultural features . __eou__ for example , in China , it's okay to talk while eating . However , you may regard it as rude . __eou__ yes . this must be a huge difference . __eou__ can you think of anything else ? __eou__ sure . We tend to think that the slower on eats , the more polite one seems . __eou__ I didn't know that before . __eou__ and we never sip or slurp the soup loudly . we quietly like little mouthfuls . __eou__ i got it . i'll bear it in mind . __eou__ don't worry . i'm sure our etiquette will become a natural part of your behavior as time goes by . __eou__ I hope so . __eou__
How's your job search going ? __eou__ I only started looking for a job a few days ago . __eou__ have you finished compiling your resume ? __eou__ yes , I was precise with every word in my resume ? __eou__ that's good . Don't forget to design the format . An attractive format is as important as the content . __eou__ absolutely , I've highlighted all my strengths and the resume is clear and easy to read . __eou__ good . How about your cover letter ? __eou__ a cover letter ? I've never thought about that . Won't a CV do for my job application ? __eou__ no , a CV is not enough . You should also attach it with a cover letter . Don't overlook it . You're faced with fierce competition in the job market . If your cover letter cannot stand out in the pile of __eou__ sounds reasonable.Even if I'm the right one for the job , many people are applying for the same vacancy at the same time , so I should try my best to catch the Human Resources manager's attention . __eou__ yes , you're right . All your preparation efforts are to help you land a job interview . __eou__ got it . I'll start right now . __eou__
I just received a phone call for an interview next week . __eou__ Congratulations ! This is your first interview ever . __eou__ thank you , but I'm nervous . I don't know what to do.Could you tell me what should I do before an interview ? __eou__ sure , you should prepare so that you can give proper response when you're being interviewed . __eou__ yeah , besides my personal introduction , what else should I prepare ? __eou__ you should collect as much information about the company and the position you're applying for as you can . It is important to show that you've done some research into the company . The interviewers Wil __eou__ then what should I do when I'm being interviewed ? __eou__ smile at the interviewers and look them in their eyes while trying to persuade them to select you . Try to act natural , let your personality , ability and interpersonal skills shine through the interview __eou__ are there any other things I should pay attention to ? __eou__ yeah , wear formal clothes to your interview and do be punctual . That'll leave your interviewers with a good first impression . __eou__
Have you made up your mind about not going back to your hometown after graduation ? Where else would you go ? __eou__ I would try to land a job in Beijing . I just want to go to one of the big cities . __eou__ why ? __eou__ many say more development opportunities can be found there . __eou__ that's true . Beijing is the political , economic and cultural center of the entire country . __eou__ and there're higher salaries there . __eou__ well , that's true , but living expenses are also higher in big cities . __eou__ I've considered that . I'll share an apartment with others to save the rent , and the cost of living won't be too much for only one person . __eou__ one person ? How about your girlfriend ? __eou__ oh , we had to break up because she didn't want to float around in Beijing . She insisted on working in her hometown and having a stable life . __eou__ sorry to hear that . It seems you have sacrificed a lot to work away from home . __eou__ sure have . I want to offer my parents a better life ; so , I'll have to work very hard . __eou__ I admire you . Good luck ! __eou__
do you have s second ? __eou__ sure . What do you want ? __eou__ I want to tell you I've put in my notice . __eou__ really ? Why ? __eou__ I've been thinking about this for several months , well before the Spring Festival holidays . __eou__ and the holidays provided you a chance to think over all this and make a decision ? __eou__ yeah , after receiving my yearly bouns , I want to search out better opportunities in the spring job market . I've been working in the company for nearly a year and a half and I still haven't received __eou__ absolutely . With your expertise and experience , you're clearly working below your pay grade . __eou__ that's exactly why I decided to quit the job and find a new one . __eou__ this way , you'll earn more at the new work place . __eou__ that's right . I am not the only one who has done this . Job hopping is quite common in the IT industry . __eou__ that is to say , most IT professionals can get a pay rise more easily by changing a job than waiting for a rise . I'm wondering why IT companies are always willing to pay more to new employees instead __eou__
What did you do at the office today ? __eou__ I had a really busy day . I had to work a little overtime . In the morning an important client called to place a large order . I had to check some things with my colleagues before confirming the order . __eou__ What kind of things did you need to check ? __eou__ The most important thing was to check that we had the goods in stock . If the goods are in stock , we can deliver them immediately . I also had to check the price . This customer is very important , so the __eou__ I see . Did anything else happen ? __eou__ I received a lot of emails from potential clients that I had to answer . Each time , I had to check files to see what we had agreed at earlier meetings . Each client has different conditions and required __eou__ It must be difficult to remember the details for each individual client . __eou__ Yes . That ’ s why we have everything on computer files . We don ’ t use much paper at our office . After lunch , I had to deal with a complaint form a client . __eou__ I hate dealing with complaints . Was it a legitimate complaint ? __eou__ Yes , it was . I managed to sort out the problem , but I was tied up with the matter for over an hour . __eou__ You certainly had a busy day . __eou__ That ’ s not all ! I also had to finish writing a sales report for my boss . In the end , I finished everything . I wonder what will be waiting for me tomorrow morning . __eou__
How time flies ! We have been in Beijing for almost 4 years . __eou__ yes , I can still recall the days when we were all seniors at college . I asked you whether you would go back to your hometown or not . __eou__ yeah , feels like yesterday . Now I ’ m almost settled down here . We ’ re planning to buy an apartment and tie the knot . __eou__ congratulations ! I hope when you hold the wedding ceremony , I ’ m still residing in Beijing . __eou__ thank you . Is your company going to move to other cities ? __eou__ no , I ’ m planning to quit this job and go back to work in my hometown after the spring festival . __eou__ why is that ? __eou__ well , I still can ’ t adjust to the fast pace of city life . __eou__ yeah , the hustle and bustle is really difficult to handle . __eou__ that ’ s right . I work extremely hard , and try my best to adapt to the lifestyle here , but I don ’ t feel any sense of belonging here . __eou__ I understand your position . Perhaps it ’ s time to stop floating and go back to where you belong . You ’ ll feel much better with your family around . __eou__ yeah , I think so . __eou__
Okay , well I ’ m sure you have a number of questions to ask me regarding the position . __eou__ Yes , well Miss Childs did give mean overview of the position over the phone , but there were some details I ’ d like to clarify . __eou__ Well feel free to ask me anything , and I ’ ll try to fill in the details . __eou__ Could I first ask about the remuneration package ? __eou__ Yes , of course . That's quite an important point , isn ’ t it ? As a junior sub editor we offer a starting salary of 150,000 HK dollars per annum . This doesn ’ t include a generous housing allowance al __eou__ I understand . And are there other bonuses included ? __eou__ Well , apart from full health insurance we do offer a company staff bonus scheme linked to readership numbers . But we could go through all the details of that at a later date . __eou__ Well , Mr . Parsons , I am flexible when it comes to salary . The opportunity to work in Hong Kong for you is the most important thing for me . __eou__ Excellent.Well , what other questions do you have Rebecca ? __eou__
Well Rebecca , is there anything else you need to know for now ? __eou__ I don ’ t think so , Mr . Parsons . I think you have covered all the main points for me . __eou__ Okay well listen , here is my business card with my mobile number . If any other questions spring to mind don ’ t hesitate to contact me . Of course you can also call Miss Childs too . __eou__ Great . Rmm , when can I expect to hear from you ? __eou__ Well , we are finishing the shortlist interviews tomorrow , so we will certainly have a decision made by early next week . Miss Childs will call you to discuss more on Monday or Tuesday . How does that so __eou__ That sounds perfect . Thank you very much for taking the time to speak to me Mr . Parsons . __eou__ The pleasure ’ s all mine , Rebecca . __eou__ I hope to hear from you very soon . __eou__ Absolutely . Thanks for coming Rebecca . Goodbye . __eou__
Could you tell me a little about the organization ? For example , how big is your workforce here ? __eou__ Well in total we have around 150 employees based in Hong Kong with another 400 in our head office in Beijing . The news desk staff in Hong Kong comprises around 80 staff . __eou__ I see . And how about the working hours ? __eou__ Well , as you know Rebecca , in journalism work hours are not exactly nine to five . You could be on call at any time . We do have to work very unsociable hours at times . __eou__ Well I am used to that , Mr . Parsons , so that ’ s not really a shock for me . __eou__ Good , as long as you understand that . __eou__ And when do you need to fill the vacancy , Mr . Parsons ? __eou__ Yesterday ! But no , we are hoping to start from the beginning of next month . __eou__ That sounds ideal . __eou__
Okay , now I ’ d like to find out more about your last job . I see you spent almost four years at the London Weekly , is that right ? __eou__ Yes , that ’ s right . To be honest , the first year was quite tough for me . I was really just treated more like an intern . I didn ’ t have many responsibilities and I found it quite frustrating . __eou__ So , what changed ? __eou__ Well slowly but surely I proved myself , and the new editor liked me so he promoted me to features writer . __eou__ Wow , a real step up ! __eou__ Yes , I was responsible for restaurant and food reviews mostly . I spent 3 years in that position , but to be honest it wasn ’ t an area of journalism I wanted to stay in long-term . __eou__ I see , so why did you decide to leave finally ? __eou__ I just felt that the paper couldn ’ t offer me any new opportunities . I really needed a more challenging role to be honest . __eou__
Okay Rebecca , well I think you ’ Ve given me a clear impression of your positive qualities , but let ’ s talk a little bit about your weaknesses . __eou__ Okay , well it ’ s always more difficult to describe them isn ’ t it ? __eou__ Definitely , but if you had to pinpoint one weakness what would it be ? __eou__ Well as I mentioned before , I do tend to get frustrated if I don ’ t see progress in my work or career . I suppose I ’ m quite a restless character . My father always taught me to be a high achiever so . __eou__ So would you say if things don ’ t go your way at work it could easily get you down ? __eou__ Well , in a way yes . But I must say that even if I ’ m not completely happy in my work I always give 110 % I would never shirk my responsibilities . I suppose sometimes I expect too much too soon . __eou__ Well , you know journalism is a highly competitive world , so you do need to keep pushing yourself it ’ s true . Okay , well let ’ s move on to talk about the job position here , shall we ? __eou__ Yes , please . __eou__
Okay , Rebecca . Now you ’ Ve given me a good idea of your work and academic background , but what about you as a person ? How would you describe your key strengths ? __eou__ Well , Mr . Parsons , as I mentioned before I ’ m someone who needs new challenges . I ’ m really focused and hard-working . I think my academic results prove this . __eou__ Yes , true , but how about other personal qualities ? __eou__ Well , I believe I ’ m a good team-player , but I can also work well independently . I ’ m very enthusiastic and , well I hope my colleagues would agree , I ’ m fun to work with . __eou__ What would you say is your most positive quality ? __eou__ Hmm , that ’ s a tough question . But I would have to say my passion . I ’ m really passionate about journalism and passionate about my career . __eou__
Now , if I look here I see that you completed a BA in English ? __eou__ Yes , that ’ s right . After graduating from high school in New York I attended York University in the UK . My major was English , and my minor was business studies . I completed my BA in 2004 . __eou__ Yes , I ’ m pleased to see that you also got a distinction . __eou__ Yes that ’ s right . I ’ Ve always enjoyed studying . My friends say I ’ m a bit of a bookworm , but my father always pushed us to succeed academically . __eou__ Well , it looks like his encouragement paid off Rebecca . So how about extracurricular activities at University ? __eou__ Well I ’ Ve always been keen on writing , so I became the editor for the University student magazine , which I really loved . Also I volunteered for a group called Shelter , to help the homeless in York . __eou__ What did that involve ? __eou__ Providing warm meals and shelter , especially in the winter months . I found it really fulfilling to be part of that group . __eou__ I ’ m sure . Okay , now let ’ s move on to your work experience , shall we ? __eou__ Yes , okay . __eou__
Right Rebecca . Now I see that after graduating from University your first job was ... __eou__ For a local paper in York called the York Herald . Actually , I started with them as an intern in the beginning . I was really keen on getting some experience in the journalism , and this seemed like a g __eou__ Certainly . And after your internship ? __eou__ They seemed impressed , and offered me a position as a junior local news reporter . I ended up staying two years there actually . I was in charge of the sports news section of the newspaper . I really __eou__ Yes I see . But you decided to leave them in 2006 right . __eou__ Yes , that ’ s right . My husband and I moved to London , and so I managed to find a position with a National newspaper based in London . __eou__ The London Weekly right . __eou__ Yes , in some ways it was a step down from my previous job but it did offer me much better prospects for the future . __eou__
hi . Could you give me a hand with this report ? __eou__ sure . I ’ d be happy to give you some hints and advice . __eou__ thanks . Would you mind taking a look at the layout ? Do you think it ’ s appropriate ? I want it to be formal , but not boring to look at . __eou__ it looks good to me . I would suggest that you put the client ’ s logo and our logo on each page . The bosses seem to like that . __eou__ that ’ s an excellent suggestion . I can easily do it on the computer . __eou__ why don ’ t you use a different font the headings ? They ’ ll be more distinct . __eou__ I ’ ll take that suggestion too . How about the content ? __eou__ I think you ’ Ve included all the essential things . You might want to make the conclusion a little longer . Restate your reasons clearly . __eou__ is it ok to include the pictures ? __eou__ definitely ! I would include one or two on each page if possible . Remember that you should make the report as eye-catching as possible . __eou__ thanks for those ideas . I ’ ll get to work on them right away . __eou__
we ’ Ve got a lot of work to do now , but take your time over this project . We don ’ t want to make any mistakes . __eou__ ok . I should have it finished by Friday afternoon . Then I can check those account over the weekend . We need to have them finished by Monday , right ? __eou__ that ’ s right . We ’ ll finish them just in time . The Macy project can wait for the time being . We need to spend several days on that project , but it isn ’ t due to be finished until the end of the month , s __eou__ from next week on , we should be in less of a rush . __eou__ I ’ m going to give everyone on the team an extra day off . Everyone deserves it . __eou__ don ’ t say that yet . A new project could suddenly appear . __eou__ that ’ s true . Right . I ’ m going back to the meeting . It ’ s been going on for hours and there ’ s no indication that it ’ ll end soon . __eou__ carol said that she would spend some time checking that everyone is up-to-date with their work . __eou__ good . I have to go right now . I really hope this meeting doesn ’ t last too long . __eou__ they usually go on for ages . __eou__ I ’ ll stop by if I have time later . Make sure everyone knows that we must stick to the deadlines . __eou__ I will . Enjoy your meeting ! __eou__
hello . How was the marketing meeting ? __eou__ hi . It was awful . I think I put forward some great ideas , but none of them were accepted . __eou__ I ’ m surprised to hear that . I thought you had some very good suggestions . __eou__ so did i . I ran the ideas by a few people before the meeting and their ideas seemed to have the supports of some people . __eou__ so what happened in the meeting ? __eou__ one or two people didn ’ t take to my ideas very well . That was to be expected . The worst thing was that the people who said the idea were good before the meeting didn ’ t support me during the meeting . __eou__ I wonder why not . We could always revise the suggestions , to take into account any objections . __eou__ that ’ s good advice , but I ’ m not confident that even revised proposals will be accepted . __eou__ may I make a suggestion ? __eou__ sure . I ’ m open to any reasonable suggestions . __eou__ Is there a chance you could contact the client confidentially and see what they think ? If they like your ideas , perhaps they could put them forward as their own proposals . You won ’ t get credit for ide __eou__ I ’ m not sure that ’ s a good idea . __eou__ go on . Take a chance . You could just hint at your idea . The client should be smart enough to take a hint . __eou__
What do you think of the most important things to do when running a business ? __eou__ Well , there are several things . Of course , you must do everything you can to keep costs down and revenues high . __eou__ So , do you think workers should be paid as little as possible ? __eou__ No . if you do that , the workers won ’ t like their jobs . They will be less efficient and you will get a high staff turnover . Those things will increase you costs . __eou__ How can a business maximise revenues ? __eou__ You need to invest in some good advertising . You have to know where your potential customers are and target them . It ’ s no good trying to sell computer games to older people . The market is too small . __eou__ What else do you suggest ? __eou__ Find out what other companies charge for the same products or services . Price yourself near the low end . Don ’ t be much cheaper than everyone else , because many customers distrust very cheap things . Th __eou__
We ’ re having a department meeting at 10 o ’ clock , ok ? __eou__ That ’ s fine ... I need to pick up some stationary-you know , a stapler , scissors , files , who should I see about that ? __eou__ See Julie , the receptionist . She knows where all that stuff is kept . You might like a calendar for you desk . She can give you one of those too . __eou__ Thanks . I need to make a few photocopies . __eou__ The photocopier is near my office . Come on , I ’ ll show you where it is . __eou__ Do you enjoy working in this office ? __eou__ Yes , I do . Everyone ’ s really friendly . Sometimes , I wish I worked outdoors more , especially during the summer . __eou__ What ’ s usually discussed at the department meetings ? __eou__ We usually tell each other where we are with various clients and potential clients . The boss assigns extra duties to people who she thinks can best deal with them . It ’ s also a chance to put forward su __eou__
What ’ s your working day like ? __eou__ I have a typical 9 to 5 job . Actually , I work a little longer than 9 to 5 most days . __eou__ Do you get paid onetime ? __eou__ No , I don ’ t . I get a bonus each month , depending on the value of the contracts I sign with clients . __eou__ Do you have any breaks ? __eou__ We have an hour-long lunch break form 12 to 1 . we can take coffee breaks during the day . My boss doesn ’ t mind , as long as we get out work done on time . __eou__ My boss gets annoyed if we take coffee breaks . I suppose your job involves a lot paperwork , doesn ’ t it ? __eou__ There ’ s some paperwork , but most of the time we put any information onto computers . Then we can send information to each other by email or across the network . Do you work in a cubicle ? __eou__ Yes , I do . I don ’ t like it very much . __eou__ I work in a cubicle too , but I I don ’ t mind it . __eou__
What do you think we need to do to get our new branch office running well ? __eou__ First , I'd make sure that we have a good , local , corporate lawyer . He or she will know all the local laws and regulations . __eou__ That ’ s very important . A friend recommended a good law firm to me . We ’ ll need someone to hire staff . __eou__ I think that we should send one of our HR people to do that . I don ’ t think we should use an agency , because they won ’ t be familiar with the type of people we employ . Have we decide on the location of __eou__ Yes . We have . We chose the location in the northeast of the city , not too far from the airport and on the edge of the CBD . __eou__ Why didn ’ t we choose an office in the CBD ? __eou__ The offices there were too expensive . Have we negotiated any contracts yet ? __eou__ Yes . We ’ Ve signed two contracts with companies that we already do work for in other countries . We hope to sign another three this month . __eou__ When will the branch office open ? __eou__ Hopefully next month . Everything is a little rushed . We should be able to set up our branch office and expand our business quickly . __eou__ Has and advertising campaign been prepared ? __eou__ Yes , it has . We ’ re going to target the business community through business magazines . __eou__ I made plenty of business contract on my last visit and through the embassy . We should be able to get plenty of customers . __eou__
Welcome to ABC electronics . First , let me go over what we do in the department during a typical workday . __eou__ Ok . I understand that we basically work form 8: 30 to 5:30 with an hour-long lunch break from 12 to 1 , right ? __eou__ That ’ s right , although we do expect you to do a little overtime if there ’ s something important to do . The lunch break is flexible . You can go a little earlier or a little later if you prefer . __eou__ That ’ s fine . Is it OK to have a coffee break during the working day ? __eou__ Of course . The main thing is that all our work must be completed on schedule . We even allow our employee to go home early if they finish their work early . __eou__ How often do you have meetings ? __eou__ You should attend a department meeting every Monday morning . There are other meetings for people working together on certain projects.Department heads also attend an interdepartmental meeting each wee __eou__ I ’ Ve met some of my colleagues already . I ’ m sure we ’ ll get on well together . __eou__ You are entitled to a company car . Have you seen it yet ? __eou__ I was told to take a look at it this afternoon and take care of all the paperwork . __eou__ Ok . This is your cubicle . At first , you ’ ll be responsible to me . Later , you ’ ll be working more independently . __eou__ That ’ s fine . I need to learn how you do things here first . Salaries are paid directly in to our bank account , aren ’ t they ? __eou__ That ’ s right . Make sure you give the accounts department all your bank account details as soon as possible . __eou__
Then , I ’ ll see you next week , Ms . O ’ Brian ? __eou__ Yes . Let ’ s say Tuesday at noon . Bring your portfolio with you . __eou__ Certainly . Is there anything else you would like me to bring , Mr . O ’ Brian ? __eou__ No , that ’ s all . I already have your resume . __eou__
can you squeeze me in sometime today ? __eou__ That ’ s a big order , Jane . I am really swamped . __eou__ I know what you ’ re saying , but I have to go over the books with you before I go see our tax guy . __eou__ Right . Okay , let me see what I can do . How about 1:30 right after my lunch meeting ? It won ’ t take more than a half hour , will it ? __eou__
Excuse me , Mr . Rodriguez ? Could I speak with you for a moment ? __eou__ I can ’ t just now , Susan . Could we get together this afternoon ? What ’ s it about ? __eou__ Well , I ’ d like to talk about my new contract with you , if that ’ s all right . __eou__ Oh , that ’ s right . Is that time of the year , huh ? That ’ s fine . How about if we meet at 3:30 this afternoon ? __eou__
I ’ m afraid we are really short staffed this week , Mr . Cranial . I ’ d like to accommodate you , but I just don ’ t think I ’ ll have the time . __eou__ Are you telling me you ’ re not going to meet with me ? __eou__ Not at all , sir . I ’ d just like to push it up to next week . I ’ ll have a lot more free time at the beginning of next week . __eou__ Well , I don ’ t like it , but I guess I don ’ t have any choice . __eou__
Mr . Reynolds ? Rick Murphy . I ’ m the accounting manager for Macmillan and Emory , Incorporated . __eou__ Nice to meet you . How can I help you ? __eou__ I would like to meet with you to discuss some discrepancies on our payroll account . __eou__ Certainly , Mr . Murphy . Could you come to my office this afternoon at 2:30 ? __eou__
Excuse me , Mr . Emory ? Mr . Macmillan , would like to know if you have the completed schedule for next week ? __eou__ Yes , I do , Susan . Just a moment . Here it is . __eou__ Thank you , sir . Sorry to trouble you . __eou__ Not at all , Susan . Just tell him to leave it with my secretary when he ’ s finished with it __eou__
when are you going to give me those brochures ? __eou__ What ’ s the rush ? You ’ re not leaving for another week . __eou__ I know , but I want to make reservations this week . __eou__ Okay . I ’ ll bring them in tomorrow for sure . __eou__
Hey , could you help me try and figure out how to get ready for my job interview ? __eou__ The most important thing to do is to make sure you know the company and what services or products it provides . Do you know all about them ? __eou__ Yes , I pretty much understand the company . __eou__ Well , after you've done your research , you have to decide whether the company is casual or formal . Have you decided what they are yet ? __eou__ Yes , I've been observing them . __eou__ When you are choosing what to wear , keep all of that in mind . Have you chosen what to wear ? __eou__ I already have something to wear . __eou__ I would always be ready to go shopping with you ! Should we talk about other basics ? __eou__ OK , I am ready to think of other things . __eou__ You need to make sure you arrive on time , smile , be pleasant and friendly , look the person in the eye and answer all questions to the best of your ability . You'll do great ! __eou__
I am not sure what to do to get ready for my job interview . __eou__ Make sure that you understand the company . Do you understand what it is that they do ? __eou__ No , I probably need to do some more research . __eou__ When you've finished your research it will help you figure out whether your company is rigid in philosophy or kind of more relaxed . Does that make sense ? __eou__ I think that their attitude is rather casual . __eou__ So all of that information will help you to pick out what to wear . Do you have something to wear ? __eou__ I have absolutely nothing so far . __eou__ You know I could go shopping with you sometime if you need it , but can we talk about other basics ? __eou__ Yes , where should we go from here ? __eou__ Focus on being relaxed and open , don't forget to smile and shake hands and be genuinely interested in what their company is about . I'm sure you'll do well . __eou__
Richard ? Do you have the number for that Chinese restaurant on the corner ? __eou__ Yeah , hold on a second . I ’ Ve got it in my office . Here it is . 553-2213 . __eou__ 553-2213 . Great , thanks . __eou__ No problem . Pick me up something to eat too , please . __eou__
Thank you so much for interviewing me this evening . __eou__ Happy to meet with you . Now , do you prefer group projects ? __eou__ I like to work alone on some things and then bring those things to the group . __eou__ Do you value a steady job more or one that offers a chance to move ahead ? __eou__ I want to grow in my job and move ahead . __eou__ Could you work for us in another state , if need be ? __eou__ I need to stay in the area because of my family . __eou__ How much do you need to make per year ? __eou__ 75,000 per year . __eou__ Yikes ! Thanks for your interest in this job . We ’ ll be getting back to you . __eou__
Can you help me plan the office party ? __eou__ Sure . What do you need the most help with , the food or entertainment ? __eou__ I need help with food . __eou__ OK , well , let's coordinate our efforts . Should this party be formal or casual ? __eou__ I think it should be casual . __eou__ I agree . Next , we have to decide on food . We have a choice of Chinese or Continental Cuisine . Which one should we have ? __eou__ I would prefer Chinese food for this party . __eou__ Perfect choice . For music , should we have a live band or a DJ ? __eou__ I think we should hire a live band . __eou__ OK then . Well , I will work on my part and get back to you with my progress on Friday . __eou__
Could I meet with you to discuss the project ? __eou__ Good idea . We could meet on Monday or Tuesday . Which day would you prefer ? __eou__ Tuesday would be good for me . __eou__ OK . Do you think we should meet in the morning or in the afternoon ? __eou__ I think the afternoon would be best . __eou__ That will work out . I will e-mail the exact time tomorrow . I need you to bring your plans with you . __eou__ Yes , I will bring my plans with me to the meeting . __eou__ Should we invite the whole committee or should we just have the sub-committee there ? __eou__ I feel that the whole committee needs to be there . __eou__ Yes , I agree . We'll make sure that they get notified . Can you find the meeting place ? __eou__ Yes , I know how to get there on my own . __eou__ Great ! We will send you all the details later . Looking forward to meeting with you ! __eou__
I would like to make an appointment for a project meeting . __eou__ Of course , I have Monday or Tuesday available . What day would be best for you ? __eou__ I would like to meet on Monday . __eou__ Very well then . Are mornings or afternoons best ? __eou__ I want to come in the morning . __eou__ I will have my assistant check my calendar and get back to you with the exact time . Can you bring me an outline of the project when you come ? __eou__ Yes , I can bring the outline when I come to the meeting . __eou__ Do you think that we should include the entire committee in the meeting or just our sub-committee ? __eou__ I think that we should have just the sub-committee . __eou__ OK then , I will make the arrangements for them to attend . Do you know how to get there ? __eou__ No , I need directions , please . __eou__ Fine , we will make sure that we send you all of the information that you need . See you there ! __eou__
Will you tell me the situation ? __eou__ I was in my friend's room , talking for an hour or so . __eou__ And then ? __eou__ I came back to my room and found my suitcase was open and my camera and five hundred dollars in cash inside the wallet were gone . __eou__ I'm afraid you must give up the cash . Are you insured ? __eou__ Yes , this is my overseas travel accident insurance card . __eou__ I'll make a report for you and please claim this to the insurance company with this report . __eou__
Hello . Excuse me . __eou__ Yes . Can I help you ? __eou__ Do you remember me ? I just had lunch here a half hour ago . __eou__ Of course I remember you . __eou__ I think I lost my wallet here . __eou__ Oh , no . Really ? I didn't see anything . __eou__ Really ? You didn't find a wallet ? __eou__ No , I didn't . Would you like to go look by the table with me ? __eou__ Yes , I would . It's not here . And it's not on the floor.Has anyone sat at this table since we left ? __eou__ No . It's been empty the whole time . __eou__ Hmm . I don't know how it could have happened . __eou__ I remember , sir , that your friend took the bill.You didn't pay for the lunch yourself , did you ? __eou__ No . My friend did . __eou__ Then are you sure you took your wallet out of your pocket while you were here ? __eou__ No , I'm not sure . But I usually take out my wallet when I sit down.It ' s uncomfortable to sit on it . So I usually put it next to me on the table . __eou__ Maybe you lost it before you came here . Or maybe you left it at home . __eou__ I don't think it's at home . I think I had it when I left the house.But what should I do ? __eou__ Well , the first thing you should do is make sure it's not at home.Then , if it isn't , you need to call your credit card companies and cancel your cards . Next , you need to replace whatever you lost , your driver's license , things like that . __eou__ Should I call the police ? __eou__ You can if you want . But the police usually don't do anything about lost wallets . __eou__ Hmm . I'll go home and check . Maybe you're right . Maybe it's at home . __eou__ I'm sorry we couldn't find it , sir . __eou__ Thanks for your help . __eou__
Oh , my God ! What's this ? __eou__ What ? __eou__ Look ! This window is open . __eou__ Did you open it before we left ? __eou__ Are you kidding ? It's winter . Why would I open it ? __eou__ I don't know . Wait . Is this yours ? __eou__ No ! Oh , my God ! Someone has broken into the house . __eou__ It looks that way . That's probably why the door wasn't locked when we came in . __eou__ I locked it when I left though . __eou__ Yes , but the robber broke in.Then , when he left , he left through the door . So it wasn't locked . __eou__ I don't care about that , Allen ! What did he steal ? That's the question ! __eou__ Look around . __eou__ The TV's still here . __eou__ And your stereo too . So what did he steal ? We have to go look upstairs . __eou__ But what if someone's still up there ? __eou__ I don't think there will be . He left through the door , remember ? __eou__
There's someone coming . __eou__ It took them four minutes to get here . That was pretty fast . __eou__ Yes , it's fast . But four minutes is enough to do fifty thousand dollars damage . __eou__ I guess the fire wasn't in the tool shed after all.It looks like the back of the house was burning . __eou__ I wonder if anyone can call the Ridleys about this . Do you know them well ? __eou__ Not really . __eou__ Do you know where they're vacationing ? __eou__ I think they went to Mexico , but I'm not sure.It ' s a bad thing to return home to.They ' ll come home from their trip , and they'll see half their house burned . __eou__ Yes , but at least this way no one gets hurt.It ' s better to have a fire in your house when you're not home . Don't you think ? __eou__ Yes , I suppose . It's a dangerous thing if a fire starts when people are sleeping . __eou__
Hi ! What are you watching ? __eou__ It ’ s a programme about islam . It ’ s very interesting . __eou__ Wow ! So many people ! Where are they and what are they doing ? __eou__ They are muslims on a pilgrimage to mecca . Muslims call this pilgrimage haj . __eou__ Why do they go there ? __eou__ Muslims believe that every man who is able should go on a haj at least once in his life . Mecca is the spiritual centre of the muslim faith . __eou__ When muslims pray , they face towards mecca . __eou__ That ’ s right . Unfortunately , so many people go on the haj each year that there are often stamped and people get killed . __eou__ I heard about that . The pilgrims must walk around a large , sacred black stone . __eou__ That ’ s right . That ’ s when accidents often happen . The Saudi government tries to limit the number of pilgrims , to reduce the chances of accidents . __eou__ Pilgrimages are common in many faiths . __eou__ Yes . In England , Christian pilgrims might go to Canterbury and many Christians go to the Vatican on pilgrimages . __eou__ Isn ’ t there a place in france where people go to get healed ? __eou__ I think that place is Lourdes . There are many stories of people being healed after visiting there . __eou__ Do you think that there is something magical about that place ? __eou__ Personally . I think that people believe they will be healed and that faith causes a change in their mind that cures them . I don ’ t think place is magical in any way . __eou__
Are you watching another news report about the war ? __eou__ Yes . The two sides declared a short ceasefire but it broke down earlier today . Several military target were destroyed by bombing . Many civilians were among the dead and wounded . __eou__ How did this war start ? __eou__ Bout side claim a small area of territory . Both sides tried to build border fences and began attacking each other . __eou__ Politicians from both sides sound increasingly belligerent . Neither side wants to compromise . __eou__ Relief agencies report that many civilians are in desperate need of food and shelter . Several European countries have agreed to send aid , but are afraid that their planes will be shot down . __eou__ What do you think will happen ? __eou__ Both countries are very poor . Soon they will run out of money to finance the war . Then , perhaps , they will negotiate . __eou__ It would be much simpler and cheaper if they negotiated first . __eou__
Why are you holding me in this jail cell ? __eou__ We'd like to hear your account of the events of last night . __eou__
What do you think are the main causes of war today ? __eou__ I ’ d say the main reason is poverty . Countries and their people get frustrated because they have so little . If their neighbors have some resources , they try to steal them by military force . __eou__ It seems that a lot of wars nowadays are really civil wars . People from different ethnic groups in the same country sometimes fight for power in that country . __eou__ several of those civil wars have been going on for years and years . It seems they will never end . __eou__ How do you think they could be ended ? __eou__ I don ’ t think that there is any easy way . The united nations could send peacekeepers into the country . At least then the warring parties could be forced to negotiate . The thing is to find the real pro __eou__ So , if the cause is poverty , there should be a programme to make the country richer . If the problem is resources , share them . __eou__ It sounds easy when you say it like that . In reality , it ’ s harder to make peace between countries . __eou__ Yes . It is . One way to stop countries fighting is to cut off their financial support . Wars are very expensive . __eou__ The problem is that many poor people might suffer . __eou__
Hey man , you wanna buy some weed ? __eou__ Some what ? __eou__ Weed ! You know ?

How does the political system work in your country ? __eou__ We have hundreds of constituencies and the votes in each one elect a member of parliament . Most people call them mp ’ s . __eou__ Each mp belongs to a political party , right ? __eou__ Almost all of them do . A few are independent . That means that they do not belong to a party . If one party more than half of the mp ’ s . they form a government . That means that they choose a prime minister can cabinet members . __eou__ What ’ s a cabinet ? __eou__ This is a small group of people-perhaps 25 mp ’ s who are usually ministers . They make all the big decision and discuss laws and policy . __eou__ Can any mp make a law ? __eou__ Any mp can present a law to parliament . The proposed law is debated and voted on . If it is accepted , it becomes law . __eou__ I suppose a proposed a law needs the support of the big political parties . __eou__ Yes , it does , because they have most of the mp ’ s . most mp ’ s vote the way their party wants them to . __eou__ How do people choose which party or candidate to vote for ? __eou__ They produce manifesto . These documents which states their policies . Some people just vote for the same party every time there is an election . Votes who often change the party they vote for are called floating voters . __eou__

What's the matter here ? __eou__ Somebody broke into my house in the morning . __eou__ When did you find out ? __eou__ About 12 o'clock , when I came home from work . __eou__ Apparently forced entry . The lock is battered to pieces . __eou__ I wonder how the burglar did it . __eou__ He is so unskillful . I have never seen such an awkward burglar . __eou__ That's because we have a strong lock . __eou__ Probably . Let's check the inside then . __eou__ Did you find anything ? __eou__ Yes , the house was in a terrible mess . It was almost turned upside down by the burglar . __eou__ Oh , er ... sorry that's because we didn't have time to clean it . __eou__ You mean it is not created by the burglar ? __eou__ Definitely not , sir . __eou__

How do we do timesheets here ? __eou__ They are actually fairly straightforward . Do you know where the blanks are kept ? __eou__ Yes , I already have one . __eou__ OK , well after you take one out of that second drawer , you put your name on the top . Do you see ? __eou__ I am kind of confused . __eou__ Next you fill in all of your hours for each day and total them . Do you know how to show time on a 24 - hour clock ? __eou__ I'm not quite sure . __eou__ Midnight is zero and when you put the minutes in , make sure that you show them with a dot followed by the minutes . Do you understand ? __eou__ No , I have no idea what you are talking about . __eou__ It's easy , just write in the hours , total it , sign it , and put it in the box . __eou__ Thanks for your help . __eou__ Try it and if you can't do it , one of us can always help you later . __eou__
Can you help me with my timesheet ? __eou__ Sure ! I can help you .

OK ? __eou__ Yes , I can do that . __eou__ Now you have to fill in the hours in the blanks and total the hours for the week . Do you know how to use military time ? __eou__ No , I don't know what that is . __eou__ OK , so we just start counting hours at midnight and record it . Show all minutes as a dot and then write how many minutes . OK ? __eou__ Yes , I understand how to do this . __eou__ After you total your hours , make sure you sign it and turn it in to your supervisor . __eou__ That was easy ! __eou__ Good luck and let me know if you need any help later on . __eou__
I need help with my timesheet . __eou__ OK , no problem . Have you found the blank ones ? __eou__ Yes , I have seen them . __eou__ Yes , well put your name on it after you have downloaded it off the company website . OK ? __eou__ Yes , I understand what to do . __eou__ You fill in the hours and total them for the week . Have you ever used a 24 hour clock ? __eou__ What ? Huh ? __eou__ So after you noted the hours , starting at zero which is midnight , you just write down the minutes as a dot followed by minutes . Get it ? __eou__ Huh ? What ? __eou__ Just make sure you show your total , sign it , and turn it in . __eou__ I thought you said this was easy . __eou__ You are a quick learner . I don't think you'll have any trouble with this . __eou__
When could we meet to discuss the project ? __eou__ I will be available on Monday or Tuesday . Choose which day is best for you . __eou__ I prefer Monday . __eou__ Good . Can you come in the morning or would afternoon be best ? __eou__ Either one is OK . __eou__ Great ! When I check with the others , I will send you an exact time . When you come , be prepared to do your presentation . __eou__ I will be prepared to do my presentation . __eou__ Who would you like to see there ? Just the sub-committee or should we ask the whole committee ? __eou__ Everyone needs to be there . __eou__ That will probably be best . Do you need help with directions ? __eou__ I think I know where it is . Maybe you could send me directions just to make sure . __eou__ OK . We will e-mail you all the information you need tomorrow . Have a good day ! __eou__
I want to make a phone call . Can you show me how ? __eou__ Of course , pick up the receiver , hit a button and listen for a tone . Are you hearing it ? __eou__ Yes , now what do I do ? __eou__ Well , after you dial 9 on the keypad , you should hear the tone change . __eou__ No , nothing changed . __eou__ When you dial 9 and hear the tone change it means you have an outside line . Who are you trying to call ? __eou__ I am trying to call my boss . __eou__ For an outside call you now just dial the number . For a company number you need to know the extension . Do you have a list of extensions ? __eou__ I know a few extensions but I don't know them all . __eou__ You can always look an extension up on the company website . __eou__

Well , after you get the line to change you have an outside line . Who are you trying to call ? __eou__ I am trying to call a client . __eou__ To call a number on the outside you now just dial the number . For inside calls , punch in the extension number . Has someone given you an extension list ? __eou__ No , I don't know anyone's extension . __eou__ All of the extensions are listed on the wall chart over there if you ever need help . __eou__

Hey , John ! What do you think are the main causes of war today ? __eou__ It's hard to say ! But it seems that a lot of wars nowadays are civil wars . People from different ethnic groups in the same country sometimes fight for power in that country . __eou__ Yeah , several of those civil wars have been going on for years and years . It seems they will never end . __eou__ How do you think they could be ended ? __eou__ I don't think that there is any easy way . __eou__ I think one better way to stop it is to cut off their financial support . __eou__ Yeah , you are right ! __eou__
How do you think they could be ended ? __eou__ I don't think that there is any easy way . The United Nations could send peacekeepers into the country . At least then the warring parties could be forced to negotiate . __eou__ So , if the cause is poverty , there should be a program to make the country richer.If the problem is resources , share them . __eou__ It sounds easy when you say it like that . In reality , it's harder to make peace between countries . __eou__ Yes , it is.One way to stop countries fighting is to cut off their financial support . Wars are very expensive . __eou__

There is a very critical debate between the presidential candidates tonight . __eou__ Do you know which channel it is on ? __eou__ Five I think . All three candidates are presenting their campaign platforms . __eou__ I used to be really interested in that . But lately it seems that they end up saying one thing and doing another anyway . So why listen ? __eou__ We have to . If nobody listened that would be like turning our backs on our own rights and obligations to the freedoms that our forefathers fought for . __eou__ It's not that serious . __eou__ Yes it is . Think about it . If nobody paid any attention to anything then what's it all for anyway ? __eou__ You get really passionate about this , don't you ? Alright . I'll watch it with you . __eou__
It's a lot of work running a campaign , isn't it ! __eou__ I had no idea when I volunteered to assist governor Brown with this campaign what I was getting myself into . __eou__ Hang in there . The hardest part is just about over . __eou__ How Ay years have you been working with him ? __eou__ About 15 . I've seen him work hard for a lot of good changes . __eou__ It's easier doing this kind hard work when I know that I trust the man behind the posters . __eou__ Did you know we're trying to talk him into considering a presidential campaign ? __eou__ He would be good . __eou__

I wish the politicians would quit digging up dirt about each other's past . __eou__ I know . It really makes a mess of the whole election process . __eou__ And it takes up all the news . __eou__ The problem is that there always a large number of people who eat that kind of stuff up . __eou__ It's so small . The fact that there is public interest , doesn't say much for us as the public . __eou__ Have you ever listened to AM radio ? It's quite a different experience than the traditional news stations on TV and FM radio . __eou__ I don't remember the last time I listened to AM radio . __eou__ Another place you can get real insight is European papers .

How do I know when to tell EDD that have I started a new job ? __eou__ Work is work , whether it ’ s a part-time or temporary job or a full-time gig . __eou__ So I guess I have to report that I ’ Ve found a little bit of work . __eou__ All you need to do is fill in the blanks correctly on the Continued Claim Form , and the EDD Office will take care of the rest . __eou__ What about if I find a job that I know will only last for a couple of weeks ? Can I take it ? __eou__ It is to your advantage to work as much as you can . __eou__

I am calling to find out why I didn ’ t receive an unemployment check this week . __eou__ Did you send in your Continued Claim Form for the last period ? __eou__ I think I forgot to send it in ! __eou__ You need to be very careful to send that form in every two weeks if you want to get paid . __eou__ Can I send it in now ? __eou__ You should look at your claim form and see if it has been more than fourteen days since it was due . If it hasn ’ t been , we will still accept it . __eou__ Can I mail it in early next time so it isn ’ t late ? __eou__ Actually , you cannot mail it in early , as it needs to reflect all of the information up to the due date . __eou__ Will my paycheck come right away now ? __eou__ Your check will arrive a little late . __eou__
Is there someone I can talk to about a payment question ? __eou__ Yes , we can handle that here . How can I help you ? __eou__ My paycheck that just arrived is less than last week ’ s check . __eou__ Did you work at all during the last pay period ? __eou__ Yes , actually , I did make a little bit of money . __eou__ Did you report it on your Continued Claim Form ? __eou__ Yes , I showed that income on the Continued Claim Form . __eou__ Well , we deducted a portion of the income that you made from this week ’ s check . __eou__ Maybe I just shouldn ’ t show the income then . __eou__ That is cheating and , if you get caught , you will be fined and disqualified from collecting unemployment . __eou__
Could you help me figure out why I am missing my unemployment check for this week ? __eou__ I hope that you remembered to send in your last Continued Claim Form . __eou__ I am pretty sure that I didn ’ t send that claim form in . __eou__ You have to send that form in every two weeks so we that we will know what to pay you . __eou__ Can I mail it in late ? __eou__ If it is not more than fourteen days past its due date , then you may still mail it in . __eou__ I think that I will mail it in right away when I get it next time , so I won ’ t be late . __eou__ You can ’ t mail it in early because you don ’ t know , in advance , how much you will be working . __eou__ Even though I was late turning in my form , will my paycheck be late ? __eou__ Yes , your check will be a little late in getting to you . __eou__
I was wondering if someone in your office could help me with a question I have about my payment . __eou__ I would be happy to answer any questions you might have . __eou__ My paycheck seems to be smaller than the one I received last week . __eou__ What about income ? Did you make any money during that period ? __eou__ My old employer gave us a couple days of work during that period . __eou__ When you filled out your Continued Claim Form , did you show that income ? __eou__ Of course I wrote down the work that I had done on the Continued Claim Form . __eou__ What happens is , when you make money , we take part of your benefits away . __eou__ I am not going to show any income from now on then . __eou__ I wouldn ’ t do that if I were you . There is a severe penalty if you get caught making false statements . __eou__
I have a question about my payment and need someone to help me . __eou__ Yes , I would be happy to answer a question about payment . What do you need help with ? __eou__ I can ’ t figure out why my paycheck this week is smaller than last week ’ s . __eou__ Did you generate any income during that time period ? __eou__ I made a little bit of money , but not much . __eou__ Did that income show up on your last Continued Claim Form ? __eou__ I claimed the work I did on the last Continued Claim Form . __eou__ When you are able to find work and get paid , we always take away part of your check . __eou__ That being the case , I don ’ t think that I am going to show the income next time . __eou__ Don ’ t do it ! If you get caught making false statements , you can have your claim closed . __eou__
Well , Mr . Brooks . I ’ m sorry , again , for the delay , but we should have everything completed by the time you get back . __eou__ I certainly hope so . Can we arrange to meet on the 27th ? That should give you enough time . __eou__ Yes , sir . That ’ s more than enough time . I do appreciate your understanding . Why don ’ t we say 10:00 o ’ clock on the 27th ? __eou__ Fine , Mr . Tan . I ’ ll see you then . __eou__
I didn ’ t receive an unemployment check this week and need to know why . __eou__ Did you mail us your last Continued Claim Form ? __eou__ I am afraid that I forgot to send it in . __eou__ We cannot pay you unless you turn that form in every two weeks . __eou__ Is it too late to mail the Continued Claim Form in now ? __eou__ It can ’ t be more than fourteen days late for us to accept it . __eou__ I will mail it in a little early next time to avoid this problem . __eou__ You can ’ t possibly know in advance how much you will be working . If you mail it in too soon , we will reject it ! __eou__ Will my paycheck arrive late because I messed up on my form ? __eou__ Your check will be arriving late , but the next one will come right on time . __eou__
All right , Mr . Crane , when will you be arriving in the city ? __eou__ I should be coming in on the 11:30 mooring flight . How far is the office from the airport ? __eou__ Only 25 minutes or so .

How about the 30th at 4:00 p . m . ? – Is an hour enough ? __eou__
Roger ? Would it be possible to meet with you to discuss my department ’ s budget ? __eou__ Of course , Debbie . Let me look at my schedule , - - I have some free time on the 12th .

I can come out anytime on Tuesday or Thursday of next week . __eou__ Let ’ s put it down for 1:15 on Thursday . We ’ ll definitely need some new filing cabinets and at least one desk unit . __eou__ Fine . I ’ ll bring both our office furniture and equipment catalogues on Thursday . __eou__
Excuse me , Bill ? __eou__ Hi , Christine . How ’ s it going ? __eou__ Fine , thanks . Mr . Emory would like to meet with Mr . Macmillan tomorrow afternoon . Can you take a look at his book ? __eou__ Sure , just a second . All right , what time ? __eou__
Grant . How is everything ? __eou__ Pretty well , thanks . We ’ Ve just been incredibly busy ! I need to set up a meeting for Mr . Graham . __eou__ Sure . What ’ s it about ? __eou__ He wants to go over the bonuses for this year . He ’ ll need to meet with Mr . Winthrop and Ms . Montgomery . Can you set it up for me ? __eou__
Karen ? I need to go over a few things with you . __eou__ Certainly . Mr . Graham . When would you like to meet ? __eou__ I was thinking about this afternoon , after the sales meeting . __eou__ Fine . At 3:30 ? __eou__
Rich ! I ’ m glad I caught you . Mr . Carlton ’ s just come over here from the main office . __eou__ Yeah ? What does he want ? __eou__ He needs to see the two of us to talk about next week ’ s annual sales meeting . __eou__ I haven ’ t got two minutes at the moment . Can ’ t you go over things without me ? __eou__
John , I ’ Ve asked you not to smoke in here ! I don ’ t want to see you smoking in my office again . __eou__ I ’ m sorry , Ms . Fairbanks . I won ’ t let it happen again . __eou__ That ’ s what you said the last time ! If you want to smoke , you ’ ll have to use your break time and go outside ! __eou__ I understand , Ms . Fairbanks . __eou__
Allan , I am really disappointed by your lack of effort on this project . __eou__ Look , Sally . I ’ Ve put just as much work into this as anybody else . __eou__ No , I ’ m sorry . I disagree . I don ’ t think you ’ Ve been working at full speed at all . __eou__ Well . I ’ m sorry you feel that way . __eou__
Why are you in court today ? __eou__ I got a ticket , and I would like to fight it . __eou__ Is the officer that pulled you over here today ? __eou__ He's here . __eou__ Tell me what happened . __eou__ The officer says that I ran a red light , but I didn't . __eou__ The officer wouldn't lie about that . __eou__ He must've , because the signal had a camera on top of it . __eou__ There was no picture taken of your license plate ? __eou__ I don't believe it took my picture . __eou__ I'm just going to let you go . __eou__ I appreciate that . __eou__
how are you doing ? __eou__ I'm ok . I wish I could say the same for my friend . __eou__ what happened to him ? __eou__ he was arrested by the police for drinking and driving . __eou__ was it his first offence ? __eou__ unfortunately not . He was charged with a DUI when he was in university . __eou__ what happened to him then ? __eou__ not much ; it was a minor offence back then . He got away with a fine of $ 500 . __eou__ did they take his license away ? __eou__ no , they were really easy on him . The problem is that that was a long time ago . They are much tougher on crime now . __eou__ what do you think will happen to him ? __eou__ well , he'll definitely lose his license , pay a fine , and maybe even spend some time in jail . __eou__ that doesn't sound too promising . Does he have a defence lawyer ? __eou__ not yet . If we can't find a lawyer for him , then the state will appoint him with one . __eou__ my sister is a lawyer . I can ask her if she can help him . __eou__ that'd be great ! I know he'd appreciate your help . __eou__
What's going on here ? __eou__ You mean , what's happening ? Well , constable , I'm trying to get out of the windowand Fred here is helping me . __eou__ Why are you climbing through the window and not leaving by the front door ? __eou__ Well , you see I can't find the key and I'm in a hurry . Come on , Fred , We're wasting time . __eou__ Just a minute you two . I don't think you're telling me the truth . This isn't poorhouse , is it ? __eou__ No , it's my brother's . I'm staying with him for a while . __eou__ Is he at home ? __eou__ I'm afraid not . He's in jail for house-breaking at the moment . __eou__
911 emergency . What is the problem ? __eou__ I would like to report a break-in . __eou__ When was this break-in ? __eou__ I believe it happened last night . __eou__ Where was the break-in ? __eou__ It happened at my house . __eou__ Was anything stolen ? __eou__ I haven't checked yet . __eou__ Why do you think there was a break-in ? __eou__ My front window was broken . __eou__ We'll send a squad car shortly . __eou__ I'd appreciate that . __eou__
Did you hear anything about the robbery ? __eou__ I watched it happen . __eou__ Really ? __eou__ Yes . I was right there . __eou__ What did you see ? __eou__ This guy tried to rob the bank . __eou__ I can't believe it . __eou__ I was really scared when he pulled the gun out . __eou__ What happened next ? __eou__ He tried to leave with the money . __eou__ Did he get caught ? __eou__ They caught him before he could walk through the front door . __eou__
How may I help you ? __eou__ I would like you to be my lawyer . __eou__ What can I do for you ? __eou__ I ’ m going on trial . __eou__ What is your trial about ? __eou__ It ’ s a felony charge . __eou__ I ’ d be glad to help . __eou__ How much do you charge ? __eou__ My rate is $ 150 an hour . __eou__ That ’ s highway robbery . __eou__ I don ’ t know what to tell you . __eou__ Okay . You ’ re hired . __eou__
Hello , may I speak to you for a few minutes ? __eou__ About what ? __eou__ I want to speak to you about this year ’ s election . __eou__ Oh , really ? __eou__ Yes , I am a volunteer for the campaign . __eou__ I am very impressed . __eou__ I feel that history is about to be made , and I want to be a part of it . __eou__ That is very nice of you . __eou__ Will you be voting ? __eou__ Yes , I am going to vote . __eou__ Make sure you make it to your polling place early on Election Day . __eou__ Thank you and good luck . __eou__
Could I speak to you for a minute ? __eou__ What do you want to speak to me about ? __eou__ I want to talk about this year ’ s election . __eou__ Oh , you do ? __eou__ I am volunteering for the campaign . __eou__ What made you decide to volunteer ? __eou__ I want to be a part of history . __eou__ Good for you . __eou__ Do you plan on voting ? __eou__ I will be voting . __eou__ You should try and make it early to your polling place . __eou__ Thanks for letting me know . __eou__

Hello , welcome to IBA . What can I do for you ? __eou__ Do you offer a safety deposit box rental service here ? __eou__ We certainly do . May I ask you the purpose of the rental ? __eou__ I'd like to put some valuables inside , you know , documents and jewellery , things like that . __eou__ I see . We have various rental periods . How long would you like to rent it for ? __eou__ What rental do you offer ? __eou__ You can choose a short-term or yearly rental . __eou__ I'll have to ask my wife how long she'll need it for as it is mainly for her belongings . I'll come back after we have discussed it . Thanks for your help . __eou__
Good afternoon . What service do you require ? __eou__ I'd like to rent a safety deposit box here , please . __eou__ For what purpose exactly , if you don't mind me asking ? I must ask because I need to know the size , you see . __eou__ No problem . My husband bought me some beautiful jewellery for our anniversary and I don't feel safe keeping it in the house . Initially , on the advice of a friend , I stored it in the freezer . __eou__ What a lovely gift . Yes , I can understand why you wouldn't be comfortable keeping something so valuable at home . I think one of our small ones will be perfect . Do you have some ID with you ? __eou__ Yes , right here . So , we can do this today , then ? That will definitely ease my mind . __eou__ Certainly , just fill in this form , please . __eou__
Good morning and welcome . How can I help you ? __eou__ Could you tell me something about safety deposit box rental , please ? I need somewhere safe to keep some insurance documents ; I just simply don't feel comfortable keeping them at home or in the office . __eou__ We have 3 different types of boxes . We usually rent for 1 year and the fee depends on the size and location of the box . __eou__ I think I'll go for the smallest , as it's just for documents . Will I be the only key holder ? I'd perhaps feel a little nervous if I knew someone else could have access to it at any time . __eou__ You can have more than 1 key if you'd like , but we must have signature cards for each box . __eou__ That's great ; I can give an extra key to my wife . I feel perfectly comfortable with her having a key . Thanks for your help . __eou__ If you have your ID and are willing to pay a year in advance , we can do that for you today , there is no need to wait . __eou__ OK , I'll take a small , for 1 year , in this branch , please . __eou__
First National Bank . __eou__ Hi , I have a checking account with you . __eou__ How can I help you ? __eou__ I need to see if check number 212 has cleared yet . __eou__ What's your name and account number ? __eou__
Good afternoon , what can I do for you today ? __eou__ I'd like to get some details about a Personal Housing Loan , please . __eou__ That's no problem . We have many different ways to go about getting a mortgage and all with terms to suit you . __eou__ You see , I've just got married and we are looking at getting on the property ladder with our first home . __eou__ Well , congratulations ! It's lovely being a newly wed , but also so much pressure . Could you tell me what kind of property you are looking for ? __eou__ Yes , just a simple apartment , nothing too big . __eou__ Yes , I see . There are just the two of you at the moment . Please take a look through this brochure ; it's especially for first-time-buyers . I think it'll be very helpful . __eou__ That's great , exactly what I need to know . Thanks . __eou__
Hello , Lincoln Bank . Kristy speaking , how may I help you today ? __eou__ Hello , Kristy . Could I speak to the department that deals with credit card applications , please ? __eou__ I can deal with that , Sir . Are you interested in our personal or corporate card ? __eou__ The personal card , please . Is it possible to take care of this over the phone ? __eou__ I'm sorry , Sir , but you will need to come in to your local branch to deal with the application procedure . Come in and fill out an application form and let us have a duplicate of your ID card . You'll also need a copy of your guarantor's and he or she will need to sign the form , too . __eou__ OK ... and what deposit do I need ? I mean , is there a minimum deposit ? __eou__ You'll need to deposit 1,500 RIB initially . There will also be some small additional charges for this service . __eou__ That's no problem . How long will the whole thing take ? A week ? 10 days ? __eou__ It should all be sorted out within 5 working days after receipt of the required documents . __eou__ Right , I'll contact my guarantor now and we'll come in within the next couple of days . Thanks very much for your help . Goodbye . __eou__
Good afternoon . Can I help you ? __eou__ Is Ms April Wang available at the moment ? __eou__ I'm sorry , Sir . She's currently away at our sub-branch . Is there anything I can help you with ? __eou__ I hope so . I'm in the process of applying for a credit card with you , and Ms Wang asked me to drop off these documents . __eou__ Let me take a look ... ID , yes , form completed , yes , well , it looks in order , Sir . __eou__ Do you need anything else from me ? __eou__ We do require a deposit before we can issue you with a personal credit card . __eou__ No problem . How much ? If I don't have enough on me , I'll pop over to the ATM and draw some . __eou__ The minimum deposit is 1,500 RIB . But you will need to pay some small additional handling charges as well . __eou__ I think I can manage that . Let's see ... yes , here we are . __eou__
IBA , Maria speaking . How can I help ? __eou__ Hello , I called earlier regarding interest rates on loans . Sorry , I just have a couple more questions . __eou__ I'm here to help . Tell me your questions and I'll do my best to answer them . __eou__ What if I require a loan for a short period of time ? __eou__ What repayment period were you thinking of ? __eou__ Say , 6 months ? Or less in fact . I want to repay the loan ASAP ; I don't like debt hanging over my head . __eou__ A wise decision . If you decide to take out a short-term loan with us , say for 6 months or less , the interest rate shall be for that of a 6 - month loan . __eou__ What if I repay it early . Any perks ? __eou__ Well , we could adjust the interest rate based on the original rate and the amount of days you actually borrowed the money for . __eou__ So , the quicker I pay it back , the more I can save in interest ? That's excellent . Thanks so much for your information . I'll come in shortly to take the relevant steps for the loan . __eou__ It's our pleasure . We are always happy to have another satisfied customer . Thanks for calling . Goodbye . __eou__
Hello , Mr Mayhew . How are you today ? __eou__ I'm just fine , thanks , Jane . I'd like to make a withdrawal from my Current Account , please . __eou__ Would you like a balance inquiry first , Mr Mayhew ? __eou__ That might be a good idea , yes . __eou__ Your balance is 21,290 RIB . How much would you like to take out today ? __eou__ I think 2,000 RIB will suffice , thanks . __eou__ Actually , I have a suggestion for you . We've started a new service called Entrusting Deposit Combination - Have you heard about this ? __eou__ No , I don't think I have . But I would like to hear the full details , if you think it'll be beneficial to me . __eou__
Good morning , and welcome to our bank . What can I do for you today ? __eou__ I need some advice about my fixed deposits . __eou__ What seems to be the problem ? __eou__ No , no problem . It's just that one of them is due and I'm not sure how to deal with it . __eou__ I see . Well , you have two choices ; you can renew it or redeem it . Which would you prefer ? __eou__ Mmmm ... well , I am happy with your service so far , so I'd like to renew it , please . __eou__ Not a problem . But may I just inform you that we have introduced a new service called Account Renewing upon Maturity ? __eou__ Yes ... __eou__ You see , that means when anything is up for renewal , we do it automatically and you don't have to physically come here to sort it out . All you need to do is sign here and we'll set it all up for you . __eou__ That's just perfect for me . I live pretty far from the centre and it can be a chore getting in . __eou__
Hello . Did you enjoy the tour of our new premises ? __eou__ Yes , I did indeed . But , could you tell me what exactly the ' Priority Service Room ' is used for ? __eou__ Of course . As we provide many different services for all of our valued customers , we like to give than a special place to do their business with us . __eou__ I think of myself as a valued customer . What services can you offer me ? __eou__ There are all kinds of deposit services and also the calculations of the interest . It's specific to different accounts and different circumstances . __eou__ Right . Is there anything else that can be done there ? __eou__ There's information on deposit or loan rates , exchange rates ... __eou__ The list goes on and on ! __eou__ Yes , it sure does . And with our new premises , we have new services . We can provide 24 - hour support for your Wealth Management . __eou__ So , I can talk to my Personal Banker 24/7 . That's really thoughtful of you . And I have to say , I love the new look of the bank . __eou__
Welcome to NO Bank . It's Mr Zu , isn't it ? __eou__ Ah , Jenny ! You remember me , what a good memory you have . __eou__ How's Mrs Zu doing these days ? __eou__ She's fine , thanks . Actually , she's the reason I'm here . It's our Wedding Anniversary in 2 weeks and I want to get her something special . She's been nagging me about our furniture , you see . __eou__ Can I give you some advice on a loan , or ... __eou__ I would like to cash my undue Large-Amount Deposit Certificate , please . __eou__ Are you absolutely sure , Mr Zu ? You know , you will lose interest if you do . __eou__ Yes , I know . But it can't be helped . It's been a pretty slow month and I just don't have enough cash to refurnish the whole house . __eou__ Let me run through a couple of other options with you . That way , you can make a more informed decision . __eou__
Good afternoon , Mr Meng . It's a little late for you , isn't it ? __eou__ Hello , Miao Ping . Yes , I've been stuck in back to back meetings all day , but I really wanted to come and speak to you . __eou__ What can I help you with ? __eou__ I'm interested in putting some of my money into investment tools , you know , something other than stocks and such like . Do you have any ideas ? __eou__ Mmmm ... yes , many investors don't seem to be into stocks at the moment . Too risky ! How about Open-Ended funds ? __eou__ Yes , I've heard about that . Isn't it where many investors pool their money together ? __eou__ Exactly . Then each individual has the chance to diversify their portfolio over many different areas , it doesn't have to be stocks . And , we provide a Professional Fund Manager , so you know your investment will be safe with us . __eou__ How can you help me to decide which areas to invest in ? __eou__ Our Investment Financing Service will help you choose where to put your funds and look at both the pros and cons of each . __eou__ Is this the information here ? Well , let's take a look then ... __eou__
Right , let me run through your options . You can go ahead and cash your undue Large-Amount Deposit Certificate if you really want to , but I'd recommend a Personal Durable Commodities Loan . __eou__ OK , what does that entail ? __eou__ It's not too much trouble to do it this way and remember , your certificate is due in 2 months . If you can hold on to it , it'll be much better for your finances . __eou__ Yes , it does seem a little silly to cash it now . I'll probably need about 25,000 RIB . Will that be a problem ? __eou__ Not at all , Mr Zu . As the certificate is due in 2 months , you can get the loan on mortgage of that certificate . __eou__ I'm glad you thought of this . I'd have just gone ahead and cashed it ! And I suppose I can use the money from the certificate to pay back this Personal Durable Commodities Loan and I won't lose any interest , right ? __eou__ Exactly right . If you'd like to go ahead , I can process that for you now , Mr Zu . __eou__ Absolutely , Jenny . Thanks very much , I think you've saved me quite a lot of money today . __eou__
Hello , and welcome to IBA . Which service do you require ? __eou__ Hello , Shelly , is it ? I'm here on behalf of my company , so I'll need the Corporate Banking Services . __eou__ That's no problem ; I can take care of that for you . __eou__ I need to have a credit check done for my company . __eou__ If it's this kind of consultancy service , I'll have to direct you to another department , I'm afraid . __eou__ That's no problem . Do you offer any other consulting services ? __eou__ There are many services you can choose from . Why don't you take a look at this leaflet while I find someone who can help you ? __eou__ Great . I'll wait right here , thanks . __eou__
Consumer Credit Department . How may I help you ? __eou__ I need some info on car loans . Such as payment periods , interest rates , things like that , please . __eou__ Certainly . Do you currently bank with us ? __eou__ Yes , I do . I have a Current Account , a credit card and a mortgage with you already . __eou__ That's excellent . Well , for our Personal Automobile Consumer Loan we offer some really competitive rates . The maximum repayment period for this type of loan is 5 years . __eou__ I plan to repay it within 2 years . And the interest ? __eou__ Of course , the interest rates depend on what is announced at the time , but at the moment , the interest for a 2 - year loan is 5.29 % __eou__ So the rate is variable ? OK , that's fine . How about the frequency of repayment ? __eou__ We usually set up a direct debit system taking installments directly from your bank account on a monthly basis . And since you are already a valued customer , there should be no trouble in processing you application for this loan . __eou__ That's nice and easy . Thanks for your time . __eou__
Welcome to IBA Consumer Credit . What can I assist you with ? __eou__ My family really needs a car , we live quite far out of the town centre , but unfortunately we cannot afford to pay out such a large sum of money in one go . __eou__ That's a problem facing many young families nowadays , and we are sympathetic to the problem . That's why we have just started a new scheme ; a Personal Automobile Consumer Loan . __eou__ Great , I just hope I qualify ! Could you tell me some more ? Can I use the money to buy the car from anywhere ? __eou__ What we usually do is find a suitable car dealer for you , who offer the type of car that you need . If it's a family car that you want , we have a very reliable dealer already contracted to us . __eou__ Then I can go to this appointed dealer , see what they've got and then make a decision ? __eou__ Yes . When you have decided exactly what you want and have a purchase price we can begin to process the loan . As long as you provide the proper documentation , of course . __eou__ What do you require ? __eou__ A correctly filled in application form , ID card , proof of residency , proof of income , the agreement from the agent and of course the 20 % down payment . __eou__ That sounds fine . If you could give me the name and address of the dealer I'll go over there now and see what they've got . __eou__
Hi , buddy ! How do you deal with your salary ? __eou__ I usually put them into my bank account . I think that is a little secure , though the interest rate is low now . __eou__ Look ! This stock is rising now . I am researching it , and planning to buy some shares . __eou__ Have you invested in the stock market before ? __eou__ No . This is my first time to buy some . You can see that its historical price data is rising now . __eou__ But that is a little risky , you know . __eou__ Hey ! Do you still remember our teacher of economics , Mr . Locker ? __eou__ Of course ! I remember he has a part-time job as a stock analyst . __eou__ I can ask for some advice from him . __eou__
This is Lincoln Bank , Consumer Credit Department . How can I help you ? __eou__ Ah , hello . I'm calling to find out how I apply for a car loan . __eou__ We offer a Personal Automobile Consumer Loan . The application process is pretty straight forward . I trust you have enough funds to cover the 20 % down payment ? __eou__ Yes , I do . It's ready and waiting in my account . __eou__ The next step is for us to recommend a dealer to you , who are already contracted to us , so ... __eou__ Could I just stop you there ? Sorry to interrupt , but I have already been to your appointed dealer and selected the car I want . __eou__ That will certainly cut down the processing time . We can move on to the next step . Do you have the purchase price ? __eou__ Yes , it's 110,000 RIB . So , with the down payment done , I will need to borrow 70,000 RIB . __eou__ What we need you to do next is to come into the branch with a correctly filled in application form , ID card , proof of residency , proof of income , the agreement from the agent and of course the 20 % down payment . __eou__ Yes , I have everything here . OK , I'll come in and see you later today . Maybe I could have my new car as early as next week ! How exciting ! __eou__
Hello , welcome to Credit Services . How can we help you ? __eou__ I'm interested in applying for a credit card with you . __eou__ Are you an existing customer ? __eou__ Yes , I've had a Current Account with a debit card with you for years . Now , I'm looking at upgrading to a credit card . __eou__ May I ask why you didn't think of applying for a credit card with us sooner ? Most young people jump at the chance . __eou__ When I opened the account with you , I was a student , I graduated a couple of years ago and have a steady salary , so I figured now would be the best time to go ahead . __eou__ That's very sensible of you . We have many fresh graduates applying for credit cards , getting them and then going on a spending spree and being unable to meet the repayments . __eou__ As you can see from the statements for my Current Account , I have never been overdrawn . I'm always very careful about that . __eou__
Credit Services , how can I help you ? __eou__ I'd like to apply for a credit card with you . __eou__ Would that be our standard card , our gold card , or our platinum card ? __eou__ Oh , I'm not sure . What's the difference ? __eou__ Well , the standard card has a lower credit limit , that's 20,000 RIB , whereas with the platinum card you can have a credit limit of 80,000 RIB . __eou__ Why such a big difference ? __eou__ It's all about credit rating and salary . If your credit rating and your salary are high enough , we can offer you the platinum card . __eou__ My salary is pretty high and I've never had a problem with my credit rating in the past . Are there any perks of the platinum card ? __eou__ Yes , we have contracts with various luxury shops and health clubs , where if you use the card to purchase items from them , you can get some healthy discounts . __eou__ That's great ; my health club membership is about to expire . __eou__
Welcome to Lincoln Bank . What can we do for you ? __eou__ Morning . I'm a new user of your credit card and I was wondering if I'm taking full advantage of it . __eou__ Well , there certainly are many benefits that go along with our credit card . __eou__ Yes , of course . It's so much easier than cash , to be honest ; nowadays I hardly ever use cash . I just put it on the card and pay off the balance every month . __eou__ You know it is not necessary to pay the balance in full every month . __eou__ Really ? __eou__ Yes , you will see on your monthly bill and statement the amount in full but also the minimum payment . __eou__ So , if for some reason I was having a bad month and spent a little too much I could just pay the minimum ? __eou__ Yes . As long as you keep making regular monthly payments , paying the minimum is just fine . Of course , your credit limit will be lowered accordingly . __eou__ How so ? __eou__ For example , if your credit limit is 5,000 RIB and you owe 1,000 RIB , your available credit will be 4,000 RIB . So , your credit limit drops . __eou__ Oh , I see . Well , I don't plan on only paying the minimum , but it's good to know that I can if I had to . Thanks for that . __eou__
Welcome to Credit Services . How can I help you ? __eou__ Hello . I'm here to talk about my credit card . You see , I'm a corporate card holder and a personal card holder . I've had my personal credit card for ages , but my corporate one is new to me . __eou__ Right . Well , the benefits are a little different . With our Corporate Card you can use it for agency collection and payment . __eou__ Is there anything else ? __eou__ There's quite a long list , actually ! You can use if for business trip expenses , medical expenses , any internal payments . __eou__ And I suppose I can do that anywhere ? I do have to travel a lot for my job and it's such a hassle using cash and collecting all the separate receipts . __eou__ If you put it on your card , you can get an overall statement that lists all of the transactions . __eou__ In just one document ? That will definitely be a time saver . __eou__
It's Mrs Bardot , isn't it ? __eou__ Yes , it is . But I'm afraid we haven't met before . __eou__ I'm Greg Wu , Head of Consultancy . I see that you'd like a credit check done for your company . Is that right ? __eou__ Hello Greg . Yes , that's correct . You see , we have just acquired a new partner , the transaction is huge . It's to be signed next month , and we would really like to have some clearer information about them . __eou__ I see . So , it's not for your company , it's for the prospective partner ? __eou__ That's right . I feel it's always better to go in with both eyes open , if you know what I mean . __eou__ I couldn't agree more . If you have the company details with you I can get on with that right away . Is there anything else that you need from us today ? __eou__ The lady at the desk , Shelly I think , told me you offer many other consultancy services . __eou__ We do indeed . Such as making trade investments , financial consultancy , and of course the service you requested . __eou__ That's good to know . Thanks for your help today , I'll leave you with the details and you can get started . __eou__
Welcome to the Consultancy Department , I'm Greg Wu . What can I assist you with today ? __eou__ I need to do a credit investigation on another company , but I'm worried it'll be a bit difficult . __eou__ How so ? __eou__ Well , it's an American company , you see . I'm worried that there will be too much red tape involved . __eou__ We are able to do credit investigations globally . You have no need to worry . __eou__ Really ? I have been told , by another bank , that it makes it difficult if you want to investigate a company which is registered outside China . __eou__ 10 years ago , maybe yes . But nowadays we are a global village , it's easy to deal with any foreign country . __eou__ I'm not exactly prepared right now . How about I go back to the office , get the relevant information and come back before closing ? __eou__ I'll look forward to it and make sure all of the paperwork is ready and waiting . __eou__ I'll return at about 4:30 pm . See you then . __eou__
Welcome to IBA . What can we assist you with today ? __eou__ Hello . Yes , I've just read your leaflet about the new MoneyLink Card . I was wondering how I go about applying for one . __eou__ This scheme has just started and you will be one of our first 100 customers , so if your application is accepted , you will receive some rather nice perks . __eou__ That does sound good . I'm already an account holder , have been for many years . And I already have your existing card . __eou__ That should make things perfectly simple , then . Actually , if you had waited a little while longer , we would have notified you by post . __eou__ Perhaps your letter is already in the mail ! So , I can just upgrade automatically ? __eou__ May I have your details , and I'll check for you . __eou__ Certainly ... __eou__ OK , so you are already a gold card holder , with a sound credit history . That means we can automatically upgrade you to our new platinum card . __eou__ Wonderful ! And , you mentioned ' perks ' ? I do hope I'll be getting some of those . __eou__
Hello ! So , you're back . Do you have everything with you ? __eou__ I think so . __eou__ We will need detailed information regarding the full name of the company , the company address ... __eou__ Yes , yes . I've got all of that here . __eou__ And also , the bank and branch name the company holds an account with and the account number . __eou__ Check , check and check . __eou__ What's the purpose for this check ? Would you like to know its repayment capacity ? __eou__ Yes , that's one of the main things we are interested in . When do you think I can get hold of this report ? __eou__ As it's confidential there is a certain amount of red tape , but it shouldn't take too long . There is , of course a service fee of 300 RIB to be paid . __eou__ No problem , I'll settle that now . You can take it from my Business Account . __eou__
Good morning , Sir . Can I help you with something ? __eou__ I hope so . I'm not actually a customer here , but I saw an advertisement in yesterday's newspaper about your new bank card . __eou__ I see . Yes , the advertisement has proven very effective . Would you like to apply for a card with us ? __eou__ Yes , please . But I suppose I'll have to open an account with you first , right ? __eou__ That's right . But don't worry ; it's a very simple procedure . __eou__ Could I open an account with you today ? __eou__ Of course , it can be done right this minute . If you could just fill in this application form for me ? Do you have your ID card with you ? I'll need to see that . __eou__ Yes , here you go . And sign here ? __eou__ Yes , please . That's being processed now . As soon as the account is set up , we can issue you with a card . __eou__ So quick and easy ! Thanks very much . __eou__
IBA , Jane speaking . How can I help you ? __eou__ Hello . I'd like to speak to someone regarding my card . __eou__ Sorry , I'm not quite sure if I understand . In what way , Sir ? Has your card been stolen ? __eou__ No , no . Nothing at all like that . It's just that I applied for a credit card with you a while ago , my application was accepted , but I'm still waiting for my card . __eou__ Oh , I see , Sir . Well , it does take 5 working days to issue and post the card . __eou__ Yes , my application was accepted last Friday . Now it's Wednesday , that's more than 5 days . __eou__ Sorry , Sir , but it's 5 working days . This does not include weekends , so your card should be with you later this week . __eou__ Of course ! How silly of me ! Yes , 5 working days would mean this Friday , at the earliest . I see . I'm sorry to trouble you . __eou__ It's no trouble at all , Sir . Is there anything else I can help you with today ? __eou__ Nothing , thanks . I again apologise for the misunderstanding , bye for now . __eou__
Hello , this is Lucie Jing calling from Lincoln Bank . May I speak to Mr Was , please ? __eou__ Speaking . __eou__ Ah , hello , Mr Was . I'm just calling about your new credit card . It has arrived with us , so you can either come to collect it , or we can send it on to you . __eou__ Sending it won't be necessary . I'm actually coming in for a meeting with my Personal Banker this afternoon . __eou__ What perfect timing ! __eou__ Indeed . Is there anything I need to do before I collect it ? __eou__ Not really . But we do recommend you to read through our terms and conditions again before you sign the card , just in case there is something you aren't happy with . __eou__ I'm sure it'll be fine . How about my PIN number ? __eou__ That will be sent on to you within 2 working days . Then , you can start using your new card . __eou__ Great . I'll be in later today . Thanks for calling . Bye . __eou__
How can I help you this afternoon ? __eou__ I want to take out some money , but there's a massive queue for the ATM so I thought I'd do it over the counter . __eou__ Unfortunately , an ATM is being refilled because it ran out of money . That's what's causing the hold up . __eou__ Oh , I see . I thought maybe it was just the time of the day , although it isn't usually busy at 2:30 in the afternoon . __eou__ You are right , you've just missed the lunchtime rush . Could you fill out a withdrawal slip , please ? __eou__ I did that already , while I was waiting . Also , here's my card . __eou__ Thank you . And you require ... __eou__ 800 RIB , please . __eou__ Please enter your personal code right here , on the key pad . And sign here , please . __eou__ OK ... __eou__ Thank you . Here's your card back and your money . Please double check it for me . __eou__ Yes , that's great . Thanks . __eou__
Good afternoon . This is Michelle Li speaking , calling on behalf of IBA . Is Mr Meng available at all ? __eou__ This is Mr Meng speaking , Michelle . __eou__ Oh , hello ! Sorry about that . I'm just calling to say that we've received your new Corporate Credit Card from HQ . __eou__ That was quick ! I wasn't expecting it until later this week . __eou__ Yes , our application procedures have speeded up since we started using the new fast-track system . __eou__ Shall I come in and collect it ? __eou__ Or we can send it to you . But if you would like to use it at the ATM , you'll need to wait for your PIN number . __eou__ Mmmm ... if I come in and collect it this afternoon , is there any way I could use it today ? Petty cash is getting low , so I need to draw some money . __eou__ As long as you bring your ID , etc , we can serve you over the counter . But you won't be able to use the ATM until your new PIN number arrives . __eou__ I see . Yes , that's fine . I'll be there at around 2:30 pm . See you later , and thanks . __eou__
Good morning . Madam . What can I do for you today ? __eou__ Hello . I hope you can help me ; I'm a little worried about my new card . __eou__ What seems to be the problem ? __eou__ I received my new card this morning , but I'm unable to use it . __eou__ Oh ? You mean , the ATM machine has eaten it ? __eou__ No , it's right here , see ? The ATM will not accept it ! __eou__ You said you received your card this morning , am I right ? __eou__ Yes . I was told it would be activated and ready to use right away . So , what's gone wrong ? __eou__ Did you receive your PIN number yet , Madam ? You see , unless you have your new PIN number , to match your new card , you cannot use it . We usually send that separately , around one day after the card , for security reasons . __eou__ Well , that explains it . I've been using my old PIN number ! Thanks for explaining everything to me . __eou__
Welcome to IBA . What can I do for you today ? __eou__ I'd like to pay some money in using my card , please . __eou__ No problem . Could you let me have your card and the money to be deposited ? __eou__ Here it is . I usually use the machine , but there seems to be such a long queue at the moment . __eou__ Yes , it's the same every day during the lunchtime rush . We will be putting in a new ATM in the near future , though . That should help to ease the queues . __eou__ I'll look forward to that , I can't stand queuing . __eou__ I know what you mean . How much would you like to deposit with us today ? __eou__ 1,000 RIB , it should all be there . __eou__ That's correct , 1,000 RIB . I'll need your personal code to deposit this . Could you enter it on this key pad , please ? __eou__ OK , done . When will it show in my account ? Not for withdrawal , I mean just registered . __eou__ It will show in your account straight away . Here's your card back and could you please sign the slip here ? __eou__ That's fine . OK . Thanks . __eou__
Welcome . What can I do for you this morning ? __eou__ I'm here on holiday and I don't have a local debit card . Is it possible to withdraw money on my Visa credit card here ? __eou__ Well , welcome to our country . I trust you are having a pleasant stay ? __eou__ Oh , yes . It's amazing here . I don't think I ever want to go home again ! __eou__ That's the opinion of most people . Do you have your passport with you ? I'll need to see that and you'll need to fill in this withdrawal form . __eou__ Fine . Here you go . __eou__ How much would you like to withdraw ? __eou__ Is it OK to withdraw USD ? __eou__ That's fine . __eou__ OK , 200 USD , please . __eou__ Here's your money , your card and your passport . Please double check the amount for me . __eou__ Perfect . Thanks ! __eou__
Welcome . What can I do for you , Madam ? __eou__ I hope you can give me some advice . I'm sick and tired of coming here or to the post office to pay my utility bills . It's such a long way from my home , but I checked and you are my nearest branch . Is there anyway I can do it from home ? __eou__ That's terrible . Unfortunately , we don't have that many branches outside the centre of town . What I'd advise you to do is set up a Direct Debit Service . __eou__ A Direct Debit Service ? What's that exactly ? __eou__ A Direct Debit means that every month we can arrange for all of your utility bills to come directly out of your account , no fuss , no hassle . __eou__ But how will you know how much I should pay ? I mean , I receive my bills , not you . __eou__ We set up an agreement with the , say , phone company . They tell us how much to pay them every month and we pay directly from your account . Of course , we are able to do this with all of the utilities companies . __eou__ I see . So , that would mean that every month it would just come from my account ? That does sound like a good idea , totally trouble free . __eou__
Welcome to Lincoln Bank . What can I help you with , Sir ? __eou__ I'm not sure if I'm at the right counter , but I need some advice on mortgages , can you help me ? __eou__ Unfortunately , no , I can't . But our specialist can . Please take a seat and our Mortgage Adviser will come out to see you . __eou__ A specialist ? That's excellent , thanks . __eou__ No problem , Sir . He'll be with you in just a minute . Could I get you something to drink while you are waiting ? __eou__ A black coffee with 2 sugars would be much appreciated , thanks . __eou__
I'm the Mortgage Advisor at this branch . You wanted a chat about housing loans ? __eou__ Yes , I've found a wonderful property I wish to buy . Unfortunately , I just don't have access to the cash . __eou__ I see . It's a problem most of us face . May I ask what the purchase price is ? __eou__ It's 600,000 RIB . But I've already put down 200,000 RIB , which is my absolute limit , so I'm looking for a loan of 400,000 RIB . __eou__ So , you've already made a large initial deposit ? That is good news . OK , let's have a look at your credit details and get this started . __eou__ I already have an account with you , so it should be pretty straight forward . __eou__ That is good , it should speed things up nicely . __eou__
Welcome to IBA . Do you need any assistance ? __eou__ Yes , please . I'm hoping to get a mortgage from you and was wondering about your interest rates . __eou__ I see . We offer Personal Housing Loans , or mortgages , at a rate of 0.42 % per month . __eou__ That's pretty much the same as I've been quoted at other banks . __eou__ We offer many different payment plans . Would you be looking at long-term or short-term ? Are you looking at a 10 - year repayment plan ? __eou__ Definitely . I want to get my mortgage paid off as soon as I can . __eou__ Then we can certainly help you with that . You see , for shorter term loans , we can offer an even more competitive interest rate . __eou__ Mmmm ... that does sound interesting . Is there anyone available I can talk with about this in more detail ? __eou__ I'll get our Mortgage Adviser for you . Please take a seat , I won't be a minute . __eou__
May I help you at all ? __eou__ Yes , please . My son wants to go overseas , to England , to do his Master degree . I wondered if you offer any kind of loan that could assist him in doing so ? __eou__ We certainly do . I can give you some details about a loan called Personal Loan for Studying Abroad . We offer this to anyone who will study outside this country . __eou__ I see . What does it entail ? I'm not sure if we will be eligible . __eou__ This loan is specially provided for people who are studying overseas to pay for their tuition fee and other sundry items . __eou__ So , we could use it to pay for my son's living expenses , not just his tuition ? __eou__ That's right . The sundries could include accommodation , text books and so on . The guidelines are not so strict , you see . __eou__ That is good to know . Just think ! We've been worrying about this for weeks and just a short visit here and my mind is at ease . Thank you . __eou__
Good day ! What can we do for you ? __eou__ I'm considering buying a new car , the old one hasn't been running too well recently , and was wondering what kind of credit you can offer me . __eou__ Buying a new car is a big expense ; we understand that , so we have a variety of loans to suit your needs . __eou__ That's great . I'm looking to borrow quite a large sum , though . __eou__ With our Personal Automobile Consumer Loan , the borrower can borrow up to 80 % of the purchase price . __eou__ That's good news . The car I'm interested in is priced at 120,000 RIB , but I think I can get a bit of discount on that . I can afford to put up around 40,000 RIB myself . __eou__ That's great . You will need to make an initial down payment of 20 % , and then we can get going with this . __eou__ The funds are all ready to go in my personal account , so let's transfer it . __eou__
Personal Loans , how may I help ? __eou__ I'm going to be studying overseas next year and I'd like some info about suitable loans . To be honest , I'm not even sure if I can get a loan . __eou__ Not a problem . We offer a Personal Loan for Studying Abroad for anyone who's studying overseas , regardless of the circumstances . Anyone is eligible to apply __eou__ Would I have to get my parents to guarantor the loan ? __eou__ Not exactly . Our policy states that the loange could be the person studying abroad , for example , you , or your direct relative or spouse . __eou__ I see . What about age limitations ? __eou__ There are no age limitations as such just that the loange should be below 55 years and of course , old enough to get a loan , meaning over 18 years of age . __eou__ Got it ! I fit into that category very nicely . That's great ! I'll have a chat with my parents and come back . Thanks very much . __eou__
Welcome to Lincoln Bank . What can we do for you today ? __eou__ Hello . I called earlier in the week and spoke to someone in the personal loans department about an overseas study loan . She said to come in as soon as I had the chance , as this must be done in person . I'd like to apply today . __eou__ OK , that's absolutely fine . I will need to see some credentials before we can get started . Do you have the notification of admission letter from your university , your passport and your visa with you ? __eou__ Yes , yes . It's all here . There you go . I'm not sure if I need any other proof or guarantee to get this loan , do I ? __eou__ You do , I'm afraid . There are 3 ways to do this . You can choose , mortgage , pledge or guarantee mode . __eou__ Yes , I read about all of these in the brochure and decided which would be more suitable for me . I'd like to go for the guarantee mode , please . __eou__ Right , that's no problem . I see you are already well informed . If you choose that one , you can borrow up to 70 % of the total tuition and miscellaneous fees . __eou__ OK , that's perfect , 70 % is excellent , it'll be a big help . Thanks . __eou__
Did you need help with something ? __eou__ I don ’ t know where to get my ballot . __eou__ I can help you with that . __eou__ How can you help me ? __eou__ I work here . __eou__ That ’ s great . __eou__ May I see your ID ? __eou__ Here it is . __eou__ All right , here is your ballot card . __eou__ What do I do now ? __eou__ Go to a voting booth and vote . __eou__ All right . Thanks for your help . __eou__
Are you planning on voting ? __eou__ Yes . What about you ? __eou__ Yes , but this will be my first time voting . __eou__ Really ? __eou__ Yes , and I have no idea how to do it . __eou__ Voting is simple . __eou__ I don ’ t know any of the laws they ’ re trying to pass . __eou__ That ’ s okay . They describe everything on the ballot . __eou__ I didn ’ t know that . __eou__ Don ’ t worry . You ’ ll be fine . __eou__ That ’ s good to know . __eou__ Congratulations on your first voting day . __eou__
Are you going to vote ? __eou__ I am . Are you ? __eou__ Yes , and for the first time . __eou__ Is that right ? __eou__ I don ’ t know how to vote . __eou__ Voting isn ’ t difficult . __eou__ I ’ m not sure what laws are being voted on . __eou__ They tell you everything on the ballot . __eou__ They do ? __eou__ You ’ ll be okay . __eou__ Thanks for telling me . __eou__ You should be excited about your first vote . __eou__
Will you be voting this year ? __eou__ Of course ! Will you ? __eou__ This is going to be my first time voting . __eou__ Are you serious ? __eou__ I ’ m not sure what I ’ m doing . __eou__ Voting is easy . __eou__ I don ’ t know anything about the bills or laws they ’ re trying to pass . __eou__ The ballot gives you all that information . __eou__ Nobody told me that before . __eou__ You have nothing to worry about . __eou__ I ’ m so glad you told me that . __eou__ Good luck on your first election . __eou__
I am really excited ! __eou__ Why are you so excited ? __eou__ I just got done voting . __eou__ This was your first time voting , wasn ’ t it ? __eou__ I just turned 18 last month . __eou__ That is so lucky of you . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ You turned 18 a month before the election . __eou__ I didn ’ t think of it that way . __eou__ Are you serious ? __eou__ Seriously , but I ’ m excited that I did . __eou__ Congratulations on being a part of history . __eou__
Did you vote yesterday ? __eou__ I sure did ! __eou__ What candidate did you vote for ? __eou__ I voted for Obama . __eou__ I ’ m shocked he actually won . __eou__ I knew he would win . __eou__ How ’ d you know ? __eou__ He was the best candidate this year . __eou__ What about him being black ? __eou__ I guess America is finally maturing . __eou__ I think you have a point . __eou__
I am so excited ! __eou__ Excited about what ? __eou__ I just voted . __eou__ Is this the first time you ’ Ve voted ? __eou__ Yes , I just had my 18th birthday this year . __eou__ That ’ s lucky . __eou__ Why is that ? __eou__ You turned 18 in an election year . __eou__ I didn ’ t think about it like that . __eou__ Really ? __eou__ No , but that makes me even more excited . __eou__ You ’ re a part of history . __eou__
Can you tell that I ’ m excited ? __eou__ What are you excited about ? __eou__ I voted today . __eou__ Was this your first time ? __eou__ I just turned 18 a month ago . __eou__ You ’ re lucky . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ Because you turned 18 in an election year . __eou__ I didn ’ t even think of that . __eou__ You didn ’ t ? __eou__ I really didn ’ t , but I ’ m still excited . __eou__ You should be , because you ’ re a part of history . __eou__
Did you vote ? __eou__ Of course ! __eou__ Who was your vote for President ? __eou__ My vote was for Barack Obama . __eou__ I didn ’ t expect him to win . __eou__ I had no doubt in my mind that he would win . __eou__ What made you think that ? __eou__ Nobody could compete with him . __eou__ I thought his race would have kept him from winning . __eou__ Times are changing . __eou__ That ’ s true . __eou__ I support our new President 100 % . __eou__
National Trust . __eou__ My name is Alice Lin , and I need to know if some money has been transferred to my account yet . __eou__ Just one second , and I'll check . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__
Union Bank . How can I be of service ? __eou__ I need to know how much money is in my account . __eou__ I'll need your name and account number . __eou__ Certainly . __eou__
You voted , right ? __eou__ You know I did . __eou__ Who did you vote for ? __eou__ I voted for Obama , of course ! __eou__ Can you believe that he actually won ? __eou__ I knew he would win . __eou__ I didn ’ t think he would . __eou__ He was the top candidate . __eou__ I figured people wouldn ’ t vote for him because he ’ s African American . __eou__ That just goes to show that America is finally turning over a new leaf . __eou__ You ’ re absolutely right . __eou__ I ’ m excited that Barack Obama is our President . __eou__
Hello , there . You are looking a little confused ; can I help you with something ? __eou__ Well , I've always used the Bank Book , but now I have this card . I don't know how to use it in the machine . __eou__ Don't worry ; I can help you with that . I understand that new technology can sometimes be unnerving . The first thing we need to do is check the ATM is in service . This one is fine . __eou__ Yes , I sure can . I feel like a dinosaur with all of these youngsters and their electronics . This machine is working , then ? __eou__ Yes , this one is in service . Put your card in here , in this slot and wait a moment . Then you will see some instructions on the screen . __eou__ Oh , it wants me to put in my PIN number . OK , I can do that ... __eou__ And press ' enter ' to confirm , here . Now you need to decide which service you need . __eou__ There are so many to choose from . I didn't know you could do all of this using a card . __eou__ That's the beauty of these machines , you can do almost anything . And unlike a person , they don't usually take breaks or go off sick ! __eou__
I hope you can help . I've got a bit of a problem with your ATM . __eou__ Of course , that's my job . Oh , dear . What's happened ? __eou__ Well , it's eaten my card ! It won't give it back ! __eou__ I see ... calm down , don't worry . May I ask what were you doing when it took your card ? __eou__ Yes . I was only entering my PIN . I'm terrible at remembering it , I'm so forgetful , you see . __eou__ Mmmm ... and exactly how many times did you enter it , please ? __eou__ Maybe three times . As I said , I always forget it . __eou__ Ah ! Don't worry ; it's just a security measure . If someone uses a card and cannot get the right PIN after three attempts , the bank keeps the card in case it's stolen . Just contact the bank and we'll get it back to you . __eou__ Oh , I see . So if I call my branch they can sort everything out for me ? __eou__ Yes , they'll be happy to help . Believe me , it happens to many people . __eou__ I'd better try harder to memorise my PIN in future . Thanks . __eou__
Good morning , Madam . Is everything OK ? Is there something I can assist you with ? __eou__ Thank you , yes . I'm not sure how to use this ATM , I usually go to a clerk and use my Bank Book . But today , I thought I'd try something new . I want to take some money out . __eou__ Welcome to the electronic age ! I can run you through it ; it's what I'm here for . __eou__ Thanks so much . Right , I've put my card in . What now ? __eou__ Just look at the screen here . It'll give you prompts , you see ? Now you need to enter your PIN number , then press ' enter ' to confirm it . __eou__ Then it'll give me my money ? __eou__ Not right away , you need to decide what it is you want to do . The next thing is to select the service . __eou__ Here we are ' withdrawal ' , so I just press here ? __eou__ Yes , then enter the amount you want . __eou__ Oh , as simple as that ! I shall never wait for a real person again , these machines are wonderful . __eou__
City Bank . This is Tom . May I help you ? __eou__ Yes , I am expecting some money wired to my account from Taiwan . Would you please check if the money available yet ? __eou__ Sure , may I have your name and account number please ? __eou__
Hello , Mr Kowalski ? __eou__ I'm here , hello . __eou__ Which city are you staying in right now ? And the name of your hotel ? __eou__ I'm in Beijing , at the Weston Hotel . __eou__ Do you have your passport with you ? Or do you by any chance know the number ? __eou__ I don't have it to hand , but I know the number . It's 16211469 9 . Can you do anything , like stop the card for example ? __eou__ Let me repeat that back to you , 16211469 9 . That's just what I've done , Mr Kowalski , I've stopped your card temporarily . __eou__ But , what do I do if I need cash ? __eou__ You can go to any branch of IBA and request the Emergency Assistance Service . Everything will be taken care of , there's no need to worry . __eou__ Thank you so much . I'll find the nearest branch and come in tomorrow . Thanks again for all of your help . __eou__
IBA , Client Services Department . Shelley speaking , how can I help ? __eou__ Client Services ? Oh , hello . I need your help . __eou__ Certainly , that's what we're here for . What can I help you with ? __eou__ I'm a tourist in this city and unfortunately I've lost my card ! __eou__ Calm down , Sir . Is that an IBA Debit or Credit Card ? __eou__ Credit Card . The International Credit Card , I can't find it anywhere . __eou__ Just calm down , Sir . OK , when do you think you lost it ? __eou__ I'm not 100 % sure , around an hour ago I guess . I had it in the hotel lobby bar ; I used it to charge something to my room . I obviously didn't pick it up again . __eou__ That's fine , Sir . Let me just take some details FRCM you and we can help you . __eou__ Thank you . Thank you very much . __eou__
Hello , Sir . Are you still there ? __eou__ Yes , I'm here . What details do you need from me ? __eou__ Did you check with reception at your hotel ? __eou__ Yes , I did . But nobody has handed it in as yet . __eou__ OK , that's fine , Sir . We just need to ask you some questions for security purposes . __eou__ Please , go right ahead . __eou__ Could I have your name , please ? And do you know your card number ? __eou__ I'm Mike Kowalski and my card number is 5211678 44 , but there are some other numbers at the beginning . I'm not sure what they are . __eou__ That should be fine , Mr Kowalski . And your PIN number ? __eou__ It's 671029 , my birthday . Silly to choose such a simple one , I suppose ! __eou__ That's completely natural . Most of our customers do the same thing . Could you just hold for a moment please ? Thank you . __eou__
Welcome to Lincoln Bank . Which service do you require today ? __eou__ I'm here to ask about a loan . __eou__ We have many loans on offer . May I ask what the purpose of the loan is ? __eou__ I got married not long ago and we are expecting our first child . I'd like to buy a car for the family . __eou__ I see . What you need is one of our Petty Consumer Loans . __eou__ Could you tell me what the requirements are for that , please ? __eou__ Certainly . It's quite simple really . Do you hold a resident's permit ? __eou__ Yes , I do . I was born and bred here . __eou__ That's great . We'll also need details of your occupation . __eou__ I have all of that with me . I've also banked here for a number of years . __eou__
Welcome to Lincoln Bank . Are you a new customer ? __eou__ Yes , I am . I opened an account with you about a month ago , but today I'm here to see about a loan of some kind . __eou__ I see . As you don't have a long history with us , we will have to check your credit rating with your previous bank before we can promise any loan to you . __eou__ Yes , that's fine . My credit is good ; I banked at my former bank for many years . __eou__ May I ask why you decided to switch your account to us ? __eou__ Haha ! Actually , I felt that your array of services is much better than what my old bank had on offer . Plus , I've got plenty of friends who bank with you and they are extremely happy . __eou__ We always welcome new business . If you can give me the details of your former bank , including your account number we can begin . __eou__ I have everything right here . I'll let you go through that and come back . I'd like to have a good read of your materials to make sure I make the right choice . __eou__
As an existing banker , that will speed up the process . You said you had the documents with you ? __eou__ That's right . Here you go . __eou__ Before I verify those , I need you to fill in some forms . Then , as I said , I need to see valid credentials , your occupation and income details ... __eou__ OK , as I expected . How much will you allow me to borrow ? I mean , I don't need a massive sum of money . __eou__ You are authorized to borrow up to 20,000 RIB , with a repayment period of up to 1 year . __eou__ That'll be enough , and the repayment period sounds good to me . __eou__ We can also look at your current credit status and adjust the interest accordingly . __eou__ How soon before this goes through ? __eou__ If you sort out all of the paperwork today , you could have your loan by the end of the week . __eou__ Perfect . So , I guess my next job is to go to the newsagent and buy some car magazines . Thanks for everything . __eou__
Good afternoon . What can I do for you today , Madam ? __eou__ It's a little sensitive , actually . I need to get hold of some money , and quickly . __eou__ OK , Madam . We are here to help . __eou__ I already have some Time Deposits with you , but unfortunately , they haven't matured yet . I really don't want to cash those just yet . __eou__ I understand completely . There are other options , such as a Personal Pledge Loan . __eou__ I've not heard of that , could you tell me more , please ? __eou__ The procedure is really simple and convenient . All you need to do is fill in this Loan Application form . __eou__ Right ... anything else ? __eou__ Of course , we'll need some documentation from you . Like your resident permit , proof of salary and your USD Deposit Certificate , to use as collateral . __eou__ And then I just sign here ? You're right ! It certainly is simple and extremely convenient . __eou__
Welcome back , Sir . I trust the materials were helpful to you ? __eou__ Indeed . I've decided to go for the Petty Consumer Loan . That is , if my credit rating is satisfactory . __eou__ Your credit is fine , Sir . Now , tell me , what is it that you need the loan for ? __eou__ I've just bought a second hand apartment and I'm looking to do some renovations . You know , a bit of decorating , some new furniture , nothing flashy . __eou__ I see . And what loan amount are you expecting ? __eou__ It says here that the maximum is 20,000 RIB . Is that flexible ? __eou__ I'm sorry , Sir . The maximum we can lend you on this type of loan is 20,000 RIB , with no exceptions . __eou__ Well , 20,000 RIB , it'll have to be then . __eou__ I need some documentation from you . Such as your resident permit , your occupation and salary details and I already have your credit details here . __eou__ Everything is right here . If that's all in order , just let me know where I sign . __eou__
Loans Department , how can I help you ? __eou__ Hello . Could you give me some details about your Personal Pledge Loans , please ? __eou__ Certainly , Sir . I'd be happy to . The Personal Pledge Loan is a loan secured by undue certificates , Time Deposits , for example , or Visible Treasury Bonds . __eou__ So , as long as I have one of those , I can apply for a Personal Pledge Loan ? __eou__ That's correct , Sir . The bank will issue receipt to you and also take care of all the pledged securities . __eou__ Mmmm ... how about the period of repayment ? __eou__ The maximum maturity period is a year , but it also cannot exceed the maturity on the certificates used as collateral . __eou__ And the maximum loan amount ? __eou__ The initial amount is just 2,000 RIB , but we can go up to 100,000 RIB . But remember , it cannot exceed the amount on the certificates you are using as collateral . __eou__ OK . I'll have a look at what I've got exactly in certificates and get back to you . Thanks for your help . Bye . __eou__ My pleasure , Sir . Bye . __eou__
Hello , this is IBA Bank . Maria speaking , how may I help ? __eou__ Hi , I'm looking into your loans and I'm a little confused about the interest rates . Could you give me some advice ? __eou__ Not a problem . Which loan was it you were interested in ? Sorry , I must ask , because the interest rates can depend on the type of loan you apply for . __eou__ I understand . I'm interested in the Petty Consumer Loan . __eou__ One of our most popular ! The usual interest rate is fixed by the PBC . That is The People's Bank of China . But of course , with some loans , credit rating and loan amount come into play , too . __eou__ So , the rate could fluctuate a little , depending on the amount given by the PBC ? __eou__ That is correct . __eou__ I'm going to have to do some more research into this . Thanks for your help , bye for now . __eou__

I understand that you have been robbed . __eou__ I certainly have . __eou__ When did this happen ? __eou__ About two hours ago . __eou__ Why didn't you report it before ? __eou__ I couldn't . I was bound and gagged . __eou__ Please tell me exactly what happened . __eou__ I was sitting in this room watching television when someone knocked on the door .

I mean , I believe in evolution for example . However , there are many things that science hasn ’ t explained yet . __eou__ I ’ m sure that science will explain everything eventually . I think that the strangest thing about religion is that so many religions people act in ways that their religion claims are wrong . __eou__ For example ? __eou__ Religions preach tolerance , but many wars are caused by intolerant religious fanatics . __eou__ Yes .

I can ’ t believe that none of the news stories make you happy or excited . __eou__ well , there was one good piece of news . You remember the local girl who was dying of a rare blood disease ? __eou__ yes . Her parents were raising money to have her treated in the united states . __eou__ well , they ’ Ve got the money and she ’ s going tomorrow for treatment . __eou__ I ’ m so happy for the family ! They must be very relieved and excited about that . __eou__ I ’ m sure they are . Oh , and a local man won the lottery . I ’ m so jealous ! I wish it were me ! I buy a lottery ticket every week and I ’ m amazed that I haven ’ t even won a small prize yet . It ’ s so unfair ! __eou__ don ’ t be moody ! I hope you ’ re not tired , because we ’ Ve been invited to a party this evening . I know how excited you get about parties . __eou__
How does the political system work in your country ? __eou__ We have hundreds of constituencies and the voters in each one elect a member of parliament .

They make all the big decision and discuss laws and policy . __eou__ Can any mp make a law ? __eou__ Any mp can present a law to parliament . The proposed law is debated and voted on . If it is accepted , it becomes law . __eou__ I suppose a proposed a law needs the support of the big political parties . __eou__ Yes , it does , because they have most of the mp ’ s . most mp ’ s vote the way their party wants them to . __eou__ How do people choose which party or candidate to vote for ? __eou__ They produce manifesto .

What am I supposed to do for money until then ? __eou__ If you bring some ID with you , it's possible for you to make a withdrawal over the counter if you need to . But unfortunately , without your new card you cannot use the ATM , so all withdrawals must be made within working hours . __eou__
Mr Moon , how good to see you again . __eou__ Hello , Miao Ping , I'm here to chat with you about Corporate Agreement Savings . What can you tell me ? __eou__ Well , Corporate Agreement Savings will be based on the Agreement Deposit Contract signed by the customer and the bank together . So , this contract decides the terms and the line of basic deposit withheld while settling the account . So , if we look within the line of basic deposit , the interest should be counted at the rate of Current Deposit on the day of settlement or withdrawal . __eou__ What if I exceed ? __eou__ If it goes beyond the basic deposit , the agreement will be settled at the rate agreement savings which has been determined by the People's Bank of China on the day you wish to settle or withdraw . __eou__ Right , I see . It all sounds pretty complicated to me . I think I'm going to need some more time to think about this and make a decision as to what I want to do . __eou__
After you've thought it over , get back to me and we can go ahead . __eou__ Miao Ping , if I do decide to go ahead , how will the interest if I exceed be counted ? __eou__ It is higher than the rate of interest for Current Deposits and a little lower than the rate for the 6 - month time deposits . __eou__ So , if I do decide to go ahead , how can my company open a Corporate Agreement Savings Plan with you ? __eou__ First of all , you need to sign a Corporate Agreement Savings Contract with us . This means we can go ahead and open an account of agreement savings based on your settlement account . __eou__ OK , let's get the ball rolling on this . __eou__
Hi , how can I help ? __eou__ I was told to come over to this window if I want to make a withdrawal . I'm not withdrawing from a Current Account , you see . I want to withdraw from my Certificate of Deposit . __eou__ Unfortunately , if you wish to withdraw on your C / D before the pre-decided date , you must give notice . __eou__ Oh , I see . Will I lose any money if I decide to withdraw on it now ? __eou__ Yes , you will lose interest . I see that you have a 5 - year C / D with us . I'm sorry to tell you that would mean losing 6 months of interest as a penalty for withdrawing before maturity . __eou__ Oh dear . Well , if it has to be done , then it has to be done . __eou__
Are you here to make a deposit Mr Hayes ? __eou__ No , Nancy , today I'm here to make a withdrawal . I made a formal request 7 days ago . __eou__ You want to withdraw on your Time Deposit , right ? __eou__ That's correct . But before I do , I was wondering if you could give me some advice . __eou__ Of course , Mr Hayes . That's what I'm here for . What would you like to know ? __eou__ Maybe I'm making a big mistake cashing in my Time Deposit before maturity . __eou__ This bank charges you 6 months interest as a penalty if you withdraw before maturity . Would it be possible to take the money from your Current Account , for example ? __eou__ No , not really . My Current Account is for cash flow and couldn't withstand having all of that money taken from it . __eou__
Hello , IMPF Bank , how can I help you ? __eou__ I need to report a missing Bank Card and Book . __eou__ OK Sir .

The account number is 15273478841 . There was about 20,000 RIB inside . __eou__ OK , Sir . Almost there , I just need your PIN number .

Good day to you . How can I be of service today ? __eou__ Hello . I'd like to open a Foreign Currency Account . __eou__ I see . Well , this bank offers many different accounts of this nature . There are 7 to choose from __eou__ Oh dear . I wanted AUD . Is that not possible ? __eou__ Well , you could change your Australian dollars into , say British pounds and then open an account . How does that sound ? __eou__ Maybe I'll go for the US dollar account . __eou__
OK , now let's go on to talk about initial deposits . __eou__ Good idea . How much do I need to deposit ? __eou__ For Agreement Savings , we ask for 100,000 RIB . __eou__ And how do I withdraw if I need to ? __eou__ You can use a Type A Agreement Savings Account the same was as a Settlement Account . __eou__ I'm sorry , refresh my mind . What's different about a Type B Account ? __eou__ With a Type B Account , it cannot be directly involved in any transaction and it cannot be applied to any external withdrawal service . __eou__
Good morning , Sir . __eou__ Hello . I'm here today to pay in some foreign currency . Is that possible at this counter ? __eou__ Of course , Sir . What kind of currency would you like to deposit ? And what is the amount you would like to pay in ? __eou__ 10,000 Japanese yen . __eou__ OK , Sir . Would that be Fixed or Current Deposit ? __eou__ Fixed . __eou__ And how long are you depositing for ? __eou__ For one year , that's what I usually do . Better interest , you know . __eou__
Foreign Currency Deposits Counter , yes . What can I do for you ? __eou__ You see , I have these Euros , and of course they are of no use to me at the moment . So I'd like to save them in my account , but I'm not sure how to go about it . __eou__ OK . We offer 2 types of saving systems , Time Savings and Demand Savings . With Time Savings your money cannot be withdrawn for a certain period of time , but with Demand Savings your money is ' on demand ' , you can withdraw at any time . __eou__ I see . What's the interest like on those ? __eou__ There's quite a large difference . I mean , if you were to use demand deposit we could give you 0.13 % interest , but for a time deposit , of say , 1 year we would offer 0.82 % . __eou__ Yes , I couldn't agree with you more . A 1 year time deposit it is ! __eou__
Hello Mr Fang ! It's good to see you again . What can we do for you today ? __eou__ Hello , Miao Ping .

Our most widely used currencies are US dollar , Japanese yen and Hong Kong dollar . __eou__ I need to open a US dollar account , trade with America is going up each year . __eou__ We will transact this for you as soon as we can after the materials you have given me have been checked and verified . __eou__ Good , thanks .

But I'm not sure how long I should save for . __eou__ Well , we offer 5 grades as standard __eou__ Mmmm ... 2 years does seem like a long time . How about the interest if I save for 6 months ? __eou__ For 6 months we can offer you 0.59 % . __eou__ That sounds fine to me . Yes , I think 6 months is the way to go . __eou__

There will be a 1 % handling fee and then you need to pay 12 RIB for the Express Delivery Service . __eou__ Right , that's fine . I'd like it to get there as quickly as possible . __eou__
You're here to make a deposit , is that correct ? __eou__ Right . I'd like to deposit 2,000 RIB into my Current Account . __eou__ No problem . Could I have the cash and your Bank Book , please ?

Look at this watermark , do you see it ? __eou__ It does look a little strange , I didn't notice that before . __eou__
Is there anything I can do for you ? __eou__ Yes . I've received this Remittance Advice from the bank . __eou__ Could I take a look at it , please ? Let me just check these details ... right . __eou__ Mr CK Chen contacted me this morning and asked me to come in for the remittance . __eou__ I've got the details here . 10,000 RIB sent by Mr CK Chen from Guangzhou . Could I see some ID ? You passport , for example ? __eou__ Here you go . Can I deposit some into my account and take some in cash ? I need 1,000 RIB for my expenses , you see . __eou__ That's no problem . Could you please sign here ? Here's the 1,000 RIB in cash , your passport back , and the remaining balance has been deposited in your account . __eou__
Hello Mr Janus . What can we do for you today ? __eou__ Hello , Miao Ping . It's that time again ; I want to convert my salary . You know , it's so annoying . I wish my company could just pay me in RIB . __eou__ Haha !

So , do you need my passport ? __eou__ Thanks , Mr Janus . Of course I trust you , but regulations are regulations . __eou__ Here you go . __eou__ Thanks . And of course , could you fill in the exchange form ? __eou__

If so , there shouldn't be any problem . __eou__

That's the money and your passport back . Of course , if you don't spend all of it , you can come back and we'd be happy to buy the local currency back from you . __eou__

How much would you like to purchase ? __eou__ 5,000 Euros will be sufficient , thanks . __eou__ Please fill in this form . How would you like it ? In 100 Euro cheques ? __eou__ That would be perfect , thank you . __eou__
Hi , good to see you . What can we assist you with today ? Going away on business again ? __eou__ Yes , I'm off again at the beginning of next week . I need to get some Traveller's Cheques . __eou__ We do always recommend people take Traveller's Cheques when travelling overseas . The world is a dangerous place nowadays , you never know . __eou__ Sure . At least if I do get robbed , heaven forbid , I can get my money back using the traveller's cheques insurance . Once , when I was travelling in France , I was pick-pocketed and not only did you replace my Traveller's Cheques for free , you also did it extremely quickly and easily . __eou__
Good morning . __eou__ Ah , hello . Do you have a service for buying Traveller's Cheques ? __eou__ Yes , we do . How can I help ? I can give you a simple introduction , if you'd like ? __eou__ That would be wonderful . __eou__ We usually recommend our clients buy US Dollar Traveller's Cheques , as they can be exchanged for local currency all over the world . They are certainly the most versatile . __eou__ But what if something happened to them ? What would happen to my money ? __eou__ As soon as you purchase your Traveller's Cheques from us , you are covered . No matter if you lose them or they are stolen , we will replace them promptly . All we ask is for you to write down the reference number of each cheque and keep it in a safe place away from the actual cheques . We will need that number if you need to make a claim . __eou__ OK , I'd like to purchase 500 US dollars worth of Traveller's Cheques , please . __eou__

Hey , Mr Brown . How are you ? Look at that smile on your face ! __eou__ Recently it's been pretty good , actually . __eou__ That's what we like to hear , a profitable business . __eou__ Well , yes .

Hi , can I assist you in any way ? __eou__ Oh , thank you . Yes , please . What I need is to handle some domestic affairs . __eou__ Oh , I see .

I'm sorry to ask you , but your passport is very important . __eou__ Yes , yes . Here it is . By the way , is there a handling fee ? __eou__ Yes , I'm afraid there is . __eou__
Today , you need to pay 20 RIB in handling fees . __eou__ Can't you just take it from my account ? I can't be bothered with cash dealings today . __eou__ I must tell you that because your banking has been such a large amount , you need to wait until you leave the country to get any currency back . __eou__ You mean , if there is any left over ? __eou__ Yes , totally . It's nice to meet a customer who understands the system . __eou__ Right , so the deposit , if I don't draw on it will be blocked after you get the Deposit Certification ? __eou__ That's right . I know we have a complex system , but you have caught on so quickly . __eou__
Hello , Sir . We haven't seen you for quite a while . So , what is it today that we can do for you ? __eou__ I need a Deposit Certificate to handle some stuff in land . __eou__ I see , yes , I can do that now . I'm sure you know , as I may have told you before , you should pay an extra 20 RIB handling fee for this service . __eou__ Yes , I recalled you charging that before . And I thought it was extortionate ! Haha ! __eou__ I can just take it from your account , you don't need to give me cash . __eou__ OK ... so it'll come out of my account ? Well , that makes it much easier . __eou__ Anything else you'll be needing today , Sir ? __eou__ Nope . That's everything , thanks . __eou__
Good morning , Madam . What can I do for you ? __eou__ I need to have some money transferred from the UK , from my company . It's kind of an emergency . __eou__ That shouldn't be a problem , Madam . I'm sure we can sort this out for you quickly . __eou__ That would be wonderful . The problem is I don't have an account with you . That is a problem , isn't it ? __eou__ Well , to be honest , it will slow things down a little . But it's not a big problem . You can do it by T / T . __eou__ T / T ? What on earth is that ! ? Sorry , but I've never heard of it . T / T ? __eou__ It means ' telegraphic transfer ' . So , if you use this way it's fast and secure and can be done from anywhere , to anywhere in the world . __eou__

You do have an account with us , right ? __eou__ Yes . Here's my card . Do you need my ID ? __eou__ Please . Just to double check all the details . __eou__ There you go . __eou__
IBA Bank , Business Banking Department . Ling Ming speaking . How may I help you ? __eou__ Ms Ling ! It's Mr Gwent , from Montgomery Computers . __eou__ Hello , Mr Gwent .

We always welcome new customers . __eou__
Hello , Sir . What can I do for you today ? __eou__ I need to find a new way of getting my insurance . __eou__ We've just started a new business at this bank , Bank-Insurance Link . __eou__ Could you give me some details about that ? __eou__ Certainly . It could really benefit someone like you . Besides insurance for you , you can also get more or less dividends from the insurance company . __eou__ That sounds great . More dividends if I want to purchase them ! __eou__ There are two different types that we are offering at the moment , Dividend Deposit and Dividend Participated Deposit . __eou__ I'll go through the materials that you have given me and return shortly . Thanks . __eou__
Hello , Sir . So , you are back ? __eou__ Yes , hello again . I would like to know the exact difference between Dividend Deposit and Dividend Participated Deposit . __eou__ That's pretty easy to explain . With the Deposit , the interest is fixed , but the Dividend of each policy will be transferred automatically into your bank account by the end of each year . The longer the term , the higher the Dividend you earn . This is because it is calculated at the Compound Interest Rate . __eou__ And I can purchase that here ? __eou__ Yes . And if you already have a Current Account with us , the Insurance Premium can be paid through it , which saves all of us a lot of hassle . __eou__
Hi there . How can I help ? __eou__ I started a new job last month and I'm expecting my first salary . __eou__ I see .

That's what you need to get your salary . __eou__
Good day , Madam . What service do you require today ? __eou__ I'd like some info about your Payroll Services , please . __eou__ It's possible to sign an agreement with us , and then we can pay your staff directly . That is called an Entrustment Agreement . __eou__ I see . How is it paid ? I mean , what payment methods are possible ? __eou__ We can transfer the funds each month , at your request , into each employee's account . It is possible to pay in cash or to pay directly to the employee's savings account , no matter which bank they do business with . __eou__ That sounds pretty good . Tell me , must we use the same payment method for all of our employees ? __eou__ Not at all . We can adjust the payment methods depending on the requirement of each employee . __eou__ That sounds just perfect . I'll talk things over with some colleagues and get back to you . Thank you very much for the information . __eou__
You've decided that you definitely want to purchase this particular one ? __eou__ To be honest , I haven't really done much research . __eou__ I would recommend that you at least glance through these brochures , just to make sure that you have selected the right policy for you . Take your time , Sir . __eou__ Thanks for your advice , after going through all of these materials I've decided not to go with my initial choice . __eou__ Of course , Sir . If I could have your details again and your ID , I'll check them and we can go on . __eou__

Hello again . Have you come to a decision ? __eou__ I'm still not sure about these ' Visible ' Certificates . What's the real difference , except the amounts available ? __eou__ Visible Certificates are registered and the holders of these can report any loss directly to the bank . Also , they can be cashed in advance , before the maturity is up . __eou__ Right . How about the Bearer Certificates ? Can they be cashed before the maturity date ? __eou__ Unfortunately , not . You see , because they are not registered , they can be bought and sold by anyone . They also can be cashed on maturity in any nationwide financial institution . __eou__ So , if I was strapped for cash , I could transfer it to get some money ? __eou__ Technically , yes . __eou__ OK , I think I've got it . __eou__
How can I help you today ? __eou__ I want to sign up for some funds units . How do I go about it ? __eou__ Have you got some ID and your cash card ? __eou__ Yes . I've already got a fund account with you too . __eou__ How many more fund units would you like to purchase today ? __eou__ I'm not quite sure . You see , I already have more than 5,000 RIB in my cash card , but I really don't know how much I should get . __eou__ The usual minimum purchase is 5,000 RIB . __eou__ That settles it then . 5,000 RIB it is , thanks . __eou__
Good afternoon . Can I be of service ? __eou__ I don't know . Can I purchase Treasury Certificates here at this counter ? __eou__ Yes , of course . We have Treasury Notes with two , three and five-year terms available . __eou__ Two years is fine , with a value of 1,000 RIB . __eou__ OK , could I take a look at some ID please , like a passport ? __eou__ Here you go . By the way , is it possible to cash them before the maturity comes up ? __eou__ No , I'm afraid that isn't possible . You must wait until maturity before you cash them . __eou__
What can I do for you ? __eou__ Hello , there . I've just started using your net banking and I'm looking for some information about my Commission Fund . __eou__ I see .

Hello , Madam . What can I do for you today ? __eou__ Hello . Yes , I'm here to redeem a Treasury Note . It's not at the maturity date yet , but it is an emergency . __eou__ OK , can I see the note and some ID , please ? __eou__ There you are . As you can see , the maturity isn't up yet . __eou__ You do realise that you must pay a 0.2 % charge for premature cancellation , right ? __eou__ Oh , really ? No , I wasn't aware of that . __eou__ Unfortunately , yes . You see , this is a three-year note ; it was issued over a year ago , but not over two years . So , you will have to pay . I'm sorry about that . __eou__
Hello there , Sir . I've dealt with you before , haven't I ? __eou__ You remember me ! Yes , I'm with Li Wang Enterprises ; I'm the Accountant Peters . __eou__ Yes , of course , Mr Peters !

We are particularly interested in Agent Services . __eou__ I see . We offer Agent Services free of charge here . Before your new business begins trading , we could , on behalf of your existing company , do a series of registration and get the certificates you need . If you are unsure of the local laws , that is . __eou__
Do you have any questions before you commit yourself to this ? __eou__ Actually , yes I do . I was wondering about the subscription fee . And how much will you charge me during the time of redeeming this new fund ? __eou__ The subscription fee is charged at a rate of 1.2 % . But for redeeming , a rate of a usual 0.5 % , we shall charge you 1.6 % if you apply to buy it after the fund-raising period . __eou__ So , it's going to cost me then ? __eou__ I'm afraid so , yes .

But I can't recall my account number . __eou__ Don't worry , Mr . Brown . Let me try to check it for you . One moment , please . Yes , I have your account number here . The balance is exactly RIB 12,000 __eou__ Thank goodness . It is still there . Thank you very much . __eou__ It's my pleasure .

I'll be more than happy to help you . __eou__ I don't usually like to use Atms , I like dealing with a real person , you see . __eou__ I know it does seem a little daunting , but once you get used to it , it will save you a lot of time and trouble . __eou__
Hello , Sir . What can we do for you today ? __eou__ Bill payment , please . I'd like to pay my electricity bill . I heard there's a new way ; I'm sick and tired of all this queuing ! __eou__ Now , you can do it via our Atms . It's convenient and easy to use . And we have 4 machines in this branch , so the queues are not usually very long . __eou__ So , how do I use it ? __eou__ You just simply follow the instructions on the screen . You can inquire about your account information and use the self-service payment function . __eou__
Good afternoon , Lincoln Corporate Services . Lina speaking , how may I help ? __eou__ Hello , Lina . I'm calling about your new PIN scheme . I'm new to all of this , so some of my questions may sound a little ignorant ... __eou__ That's not a problem , I'm more than happy to explain everything in laymen's terms . PIN stands for Personal Internet Banking . You can do all of your usual banking using the Internet , no need to call __eou__ I see . How about buying and selling items ? __eou__ We can take care of that for you , too . You can get all of your usual banking services plus some new extra ones . As this service is net bases , you can do it anywhere . __eou__ That's good to know , because I do travel quite frequently . __eou__
IBA , how can I help ? __eou__ Ah , yes , hello . I'm calling to get some info about your PIN services . You see , my friend also has an account with you and also enjoys shopping on the Internet . She recommended I sign up for this service too . __eou__ That was a wise decision , if I may say so . Our Personal Internet Banking Service offers online shopping transactions , payment of household bills online , account management ... __eou__ I will probably just use it for online shopping . At the moment , I have to meet the seller in person and pay cash , if it's a local seller . __eou__ This will fix all of that for you . If you use our online payment service , the money will come straight out of your account and go directly into the seller's account , in a secure way . __eou__
Hi , Sir . What can I do for you ? __eou__ Hello , there . I'd like to know about Clean Collection . My company in the US is going to send me a cheque . It's for my wages , but I'm not too sure about how to cash it here . __eou__ Right . If the cheque is coming from the US , into a local currency account it will take 7 working days to clear . __eou__ Is there any way we can speed it up ? __eou__ There is , actually . If you can get your company to apply for a cheque from a bank in Shanghai , that'll speed things up no end . __eou__
Good afternoon , it's nice to see you again . Have you decided to go ahead and try for the Fixed Asset Loan ? __eou__ I'm going to need some more info first . I was wondering about the repayments . How long would I have to pay back the loan ? __eou__ That depends . Our repayment plans go from 1 year to 10 years . The Fixed Asset Loan is a long-term loan , you see . The loan can be paid in either monthly or quarterly instalments , to suit your needs . __eou__ And how much is payable in each instalment ? __eou__ You will need to pay part of the principle sum and part of the interest due . __eou__ Well , as far as I can see , the advantages outweigh the disadvantages . You've sold me ! I'd like to go ahead . __eou__
Hello , Sir . Can I help you with anything ? __eou__ Yes , I would like to use the ATM to make a payment . But I need to pay 3 parties at once . __eou__ No problem at all . With this service , you can pay up to 10 parties at one time . Are these parties on your current beneficiaries list ? __eou__ They are , yes . How should I do this ? __eou__ Select ' pay multiple beneficiaries ' , here ... then select ' pay from the account ' in the drop down menu ... OK , good . Then we need to enter the beneficiary statement reference . __eou__ Yes , I've got that here ... __eou__ And your statement reference and the payment amount . Click on next , then ' pay beneficiaries ' . That's it ! All done . __eou__
Which type of telephone bill would you like to pay today ? __eou__ My home phone , the landline . I don't have a mobile phone , far too complicated for an old lady like me ! Do you need my Bank Book ? __eou__ I'll need your Bank Card , please . Your Bank Book is required for over the counter services ; with the ATM you just need to have your card . __eou__ Let's get started . First , select the service you require . That's household bill payment for you . Then we select the type of bill , so that's landline ... here you go . Your bill for this month comes to 87.42 RIB . The money will come out of your account and go straight to the phone company . __eou__ Well , that is easy ! It sure beats waiting in line for ages waiting to deal with a real person ! __eou__
Hello , there . Welcome , and what can we assist you with ? __eou__ Good morning . I have a Bill of Exchange against Bank Acceptance here . I'd like to discount it . Is that possible here ? __eou__ Yes , we can do that . We require the original Trading Contract and also the VAT Invoice and the Commodity Delivery Documents . They all need to be in duplicate . __eou__ Yes , I've got all that here . __eou__ Do you have a copy of the ID card of the person who took care of the legal aspects of this ? The Legal Rep , I mean ? We also need the Loan Certificate as well . Do you have that ? __eou__ A copy or the original ? I guess you need the original , right ? OK , I'll return shortly . __eou__
The ATM machine outside won't give me back my card . __eou__ Let's go take a look at it . Do you have your ID with you ? __eou__ Yes , here it is . __eou__ Okay , I see the problem . You forgot your code , didn't you ? __eou__ How did you know ? __eou__ The machine gives you three attempts to enter the correct code and after that it assumes that you are not the real owner and confiscates it . __eou__ Oh . But can I have my card back now ? __eou__ Yes , I can get it for you but I need to go back inside the bank . __eou__
Mr Ludlow , hello . It's good to see you again . What can we do for you today ? __eou__ Hello , I'm sorry it's been such a long time . I've been away on business . I'd like to discount this . __eou__ No problem . Could I please see the bill and all of the other documents ? __eou__ Yeah , sure . Here they are . Take your time going through them , I'm in no hurry . __eou__ There's no problem here , everything's in order . I can transact that for you now . __eou__ Do I need to pay anything ? Like a handling fee , or something ? __eou__ No , you don't need to pay anything on top . We just simply deduct the discounting interest . __eou__
I would like to open a checking account at this branch . __eou__ Do you have any other accounts with this bank ? __eou__ I do , at a different location , I have a savings account and a CD . __eou__ In that case , we will need to fill out this paperwork . Do you have identification with you ? __eou__ Here is my driver's license . Will that work ? __eou__ Yes . Do you know what type of checking account you would like to open , business or personal ? __eou__ Business please . And I want the most simple one you have . __eou__ Then you would like the ' no frills ' business account . __eou__
Hello , back already ? That was quick ! __eou__ Yes , luckily our office is just down the street . __eou__ Great . I shall also need a copy of your own ID and the Warrant Letter , you can fill in one here . __eou__ Oh , I see . __eou__ Next time , you can get one from the counter over there . Or before you come in , you can download one from our website . It's really easy . __eou__
Hello , is everything alright ? Can I help ? __eou__ I have a Promissory Note , but it's not called that . It's a Bill of Exchange . __eou__ Similar to a Promissory Note , yes . I can deal with that for you right here . The difference between a Promissory Note and a Bill of Exchange is that this product is transferable and can bind one party to pay a third party that was not involved in its creation . __eou__ So , even if someone wasn't directly involved , they can become involved ? Like the bank you cash it in ? __eou__ That's right . We didn't issue it to you , but technically we are buying it from you . So , we become involved . __eou__ I see . Sorry about this , I'm new in this job and I've never even seen one of these before ! My boss just told me to come here and sort it out . __eou__ As long as you have all of the documentation we require you have nothing to worry about . __eou__
Is there anything else , apart from the Credit Rating and Debt to Asset Ratio ? __eou__ There is the Balance of Net Liabilities . This must not exceed its net assets and no business loss can be shown during the past two years . __eou__ Right , OK . That , again , shouldn't be a problem . __eou__ And the total ratio of return on assets should not be lower than the average , for that particular industry , for the first two quarters of the year . __eou__ Well , as far as I can tell , we qualify . __eou__ Of course we will need proof , originals and duplicate of everything . As soon as you bring in the proof and we assess it , it should be very quick indeed . __eou__
What can I do for you , Madam ? __eou__ Can you help me with Comprehensive Credit Granting ? __eou__ Certainly , Madam . What would you like to know ? __eou__ Well , everything really . __eou__ All right . We can grant a Financing Promise Quota , if you qualify . This means that we can deal with all of your needs in a speedy and efficient way . Firstly , your Credit Rating must be class A , and your Debt to Asset Ratio must be top notch , for the industry you are involved in . __eou__
Good afternoon , Sir . You're here to see about a Temporary Loan , right ? The loans we offer are for purchasing income-generating assets . Is that what you require ? __eou__ Yes , that's exactly what I need . How about terms for these ? __eou__ Well , we offer 60 - day or 90 - day loans . The balance of the loan is to be repaid in full by the end of the specified period . __eou__ Is there any flexibility on that ? __eou__ Unfortunately , not . __eou__ OK . In my position , I think the best way to go would be for the 90 - day loan . That would give us a little more time to sort out the repayment plan . __eou__ Not a problem , Sir . If you'd just fill out these forms , and of course with necessary clearance , we can get you the money right away . __eou__
Hello . I'm Duty Manager today ; you wanted to speak to me ? __eou__ Yes . I hope you can help . I'm interested in obtaining a Working Capital Loan . So , I was wondering what you offer here ? Do you have various types ? __eou__ Yes , Sir . We can provide these loans in both local and foreign currency , Temporary Working Capital Loans , Short-term Working Capital Loans and Mid-term Working Capital Loans . __eou__ I see ... __eou__ Which one interests you , Sir ? __eou__ To be honest , I'm not exactly sure what we require just now . __eou__
Hello . What can we do for you ? __eou__ Hello , I'm here to talk to someone about a Fixed Asset Loan . __eou__ Certainly . That shouldn't be a problem . Tell me , do you have a Basic Account with us ? __eou__ Yes . I also have a Loan Certificate . __eou__ Oh , that's good . We will come to our final decision based on your credit rating , the payment capability ... __eou__ Well , we have no problems with our credit rating , I can assure you . __eou__
Hi there . Welcome to Lincoln Corporate Services . How can we help ? __eou__ Hi . I was wondering what kind of fixed asset loans you have ? Do you have Fixed Asset Loans ? __eou__ Yes , we do . You'll go through the acceptance application , then a first review , then an evaluation and examination and finally get approval . Why don't you read through this brochure ? It outlines all of the important aspects of the loan , the terms and conditions , etc . __eou__ That's a good idea , to familiarise myself with it . Then , I'll be back if we decide to go ahead . __eou__
Welcome to IBA . What can we do for you ? __eou__ It's a bit of a problem situation , actually ... you see , our company has a Corporate Account with you , but unfortunately , we've been experiencing cash flow problems recently . __eou__ I'm sorry to hear that . We value all of our customers , regardless of circumstances . What can we do to help ? __eou__ We are going to need a loan . I'm not sure what loan is suitable for us , though . __eou__ If you think it will be very short-term , I would recommend you go with the 60 - day loan . Then it can be paid back quicker , so you won't have to consider it in the future . __eou__ That seems like a good idea , it's for wages , you see . __eou__
Mr Brown ! How nice to see you , can I help ? __eou__ I'm not exactly sure if it's your department , but I'd like to ask some questions about qualifying for Comprehensive Credit Granting . __eou__ I see . You are one of my favourite customers , Mr Brown . I'm more than happy to help . For Comprehensive Credit Granting , IBA will grant a promised quota for you , that is , if you qualify . Of course , your credit record , within you field of trade needs to be up to scratch . __eou__ How long a period will you look at to determine this ? __eou__ We will consider the first part of the year , in your particular field , and your credit rating can be no less than class A , during that period . __eou__ That sounds simple enough . It's Friday today , I'll be back on Monday morning , first thing , with all of the relevant data . See you then , and enjoy your weekend . __eou__
Hello . How can we be of service ? __eou__ I'm here to see about a Fixed Asset Loan . __eou__ OK , are you already an account holder ? __eou__ Yes , I am . But I'm not sure if I'm eligible . __eou__ To find out if you are eligible for our Fixed Asset Loan , we will have to look at various aspects of your business , such as your long-term business prospects , your cash flow , your profitability , your capital structure ... __eou__ For my credit worthiness ? __eou__ Yes , and then other qualitative factors , such as the transparency of your business operations , your credibility and the integrity of your management . __eou__
Welcome to IBA . Can I help you ? __eou__ Yes , hello . Our company used your bank to send some documents to Malaysia last week . Could you check and see if the proceeds have come back yet , please ? It's Sang Hung Enterprises , based in Kula Lump . __eou__ OK , just a moment ... yes , it has arrived . The amount is 51,998 US dollars net , 12 US dollars has been deducted by the intermediary bank . __eou__ That's as it should be . When will it be paid in and credited to our account ? __eou__ It's already credited to your account . __eou__
Hello , Fife Computers . How can I help ? __eou__ Hello , this is the Corporate Department of Lincoln Bank calling . We are calling to let you know that some documents have arrived for you at our bank . __eou__ Oh , really ? Do you know which company they are from ? __eou__ They're from Schnitt's of Rudesheim , Germany . Would you like us to check them ? __eou__ What's the charge for that ? __eou__ It's 150 RIB for the service . __eou__ That seems pretty reasonable . Thanks . __eou__
Good day . How can we assist you ? __eou__ I need to get a Letter of Credit . Is this the right window ? __eou__ It certainly is . Do you have your contract and Import License ? __eou__ Yes , right here in my brief case . Just a moment , please . __eou__ Thanks . What you need to do now is deposit 100 % of the guaranteed funds of your contract into your account with us . __eou__ That's done . There is more than enough to cover the contract amount in our account . __eou__ That's great . We will have to charge you 250 RIB for that service , though . Could you please fill in this ? Thanks . __eou__
Next , please . __eou__ Could I purchase Euro with RIB here ? I have to stay here for months . __eou__ Yes , the rate for cash purchases is listed on the electronica screen , so you have seen the rate of exchange . __eou__ Yes , I have known of it . __eou__ How much do you like to exchange ? __eou__ 20,000 RIB . __eou__ In what denominations ? __eou__ It doesn't matter , but leave me some small changes , that will be convenient in daily life . __eou__ Right , I will exchange for you now . Please sign the exchange form giving the name and telephone . __eou__ Well , could you change them too ? The dollars , I want to change them into Swiss francs . __eou__ OK , wait for a moment . Well , I am sorry , but we are not authorized to exchange coins because it is low and we do not have enough foreign coins . In this case , you'd better change 2,000 $ to Swiss francs . __eou__ It doesn't matter . __eou__ Please sign the memo on the bottom and keep your money and memo . __eou__ Thanks a lot . Good-bye . __eou__
Good afternoon , Mr Meng ! It's nice to see you today . It's been a while , hasn't it ? __eou__ Hello , Miao Ping . Yes , it has . I've been in Saudi Arabia for the last 6 weeks on business . I did have a little time to relax in Dubai , though . __eou__ I envy you , Mr Meng ! What can I do for you today ? __eou__ I need to effect a payment under my L / C . Not the old one , the new one my Assistant came in and dealt with last week . __eou__ Right . Do you have the code for that one ? __eou__ It's DG193445782100 . Can you find it ? __eou__ Here it is . Have you got the advice slip with you ? You have sufficient funds in the account , so we can go ahead . __eou__
Hello . __eou__ Hello . Is there anything I can do for you ? __eou__ Yes , please . I'd like to open a savings account . Would you please give me some advice ? __eou__ Certainly , I'll be very happy to help you . Usually we offer current or fixed accounts for individuals . __eou__ What's the difference between the two ? __eou__ If you open a fixed account , the interest rate is higher . __eou__ Then how about the current account ? __eou__ You may withdraw the money at any time . You just need to present your deposit book . __eou__ Thank you for your help . I think I'll open a current account . __eou__ OK . Do you have your ID card on you ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ Good . Everything is done . Here is your deposit book and ID card . __eou__ Thank you very much . __eou__ It's my pleasure . __eou__
Welcome to IBA . Can I help you ? __eou__ Yes , please . I'm here for an International Settlement . Our company has to effect payment , and it needs to be done today . Here's the advice slip for the payment . __eou__ Thanks . I'm sorry to say that you need to get this stamped . There is no stamp on this slip and it is essential before I can process it for you . __eou__ I see . So , I need to stamp it . And sign it too ? __eou__ Yes , that's right . Down here , at the bottom right hand corner to show that you agree to pay the printed amount . __eou__ I'll go back to the office and get it sorted and pop back later . Thanks , bye for now . __eou__
Hello , Sir . What can we do for you today ? __eou__ Hello . I've been asked to come and see about something called L / C ? What is it exactly ? __eou__ L / C stands for ' letter of credit ' . This is necessary for trade between two countries . A Letter of Credit is quite literally that — a letter addressed by the buyer's bank to the seller's bank stating that they could vouch for their good customer , the buyer , and that they would pay the seller in case of the buyer's default . Nowadays , it's sometimes used for domestic trade too . __eou__ So the other party could be across the world or just on the other side of the street ! __eou__
Hello , Sir . How can we help you today ? __eou__ I need to find out some more information for L / C . I would like an outline of responsibilities , both ours , yours and the beneficiary , please . __eou__ OK , to start , the conditions are specified by the buyer and may include Insurance Forms , Way Bills , Bills of Lading , Customs forms , various certificates . __eou__ OK , got it . Is there anything else I need to know before we go ahead ? __eou__ Just that in effect , a basic Letter of Credit is a financial contract between the bank , the bank's customer , and the beneficiary , and this contract involves the transfer of goods or services against funds . __eou__ That sounds fine , thanks for that . Let's go ahead ! __eou__
Hello . Is everything OK , there ? __eou__ I'm having a little trouble with this form . __eou__ What seems to be the problem ? __eou__ There are two types of L / C here and I'm not sure which one I want . __eou__ That's right , there's ' revocable ' and ' irrevocable ' . We usually go for the irrevocable one , it's the most popular . __eou__ So , I should choose that one ? __eou__ I would recommend it , yes . Then you just need to complete that form . __eou__ I see . It's very nice of you to help me . Is this form alright ? __eou__ Yes , that's all in order . Let's get this processed for you , then . __eou__
Good afternoon . May I help you ? __eou__ Yes , I'd like to make a deposit . __eou__ Which type of deposit do you prefer , time deposit or current deposit ? __eou__ I prefer time deposit . __eou__ Okey . The interest rate for time deposit is higher . Could you tell me it's RIB deposit or currency deposit ? __eou__ RIB deposit . __eou__ Is it your first time to make a deposit here ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ The term of time deposit ranges from three months to five years , including three months , six months , one year , two years , three years and five years . How long would you like to keep your deposit ? __eou__ Six months . __eou__ Fill in this slip in ink , please . __eou__ Here you are . __eou__ All right . Just a moment , please . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__
Hello . What can I do for you today ? __eou__ I've got some documents here that go with the L / C our company opened 10 days ago . I think there is something wrong . __eou__ Really ? Have you checked everything carefully ? __eou__ Very carefully , that's when I found the problem . __eou__ Ah , I see . The goods description is totally different from what you are expecting , right ? __eou__ Yep , you've got it ! What should we do ? __eou__ Usually , if the problem is insignificant I advise the customer to go ahead ; it's normally a translation problem or something like that . But this does seem a little more serious . I suggest you get back on to them right now and ask them about it . Hopefully you can sort it out over the phone . __eou__ That's a great idea ; thanks for your help . __eou__
Hello , welcome to Lincoln Bank . What can we do for you today ? __eou__ I want to effect payment under an L / C today . __eou__ No problem . OK ... just checking for you . Ah , I'm afraid there aren't enough funds in your account to cover this transaction . What you can do is buy some US dollars , using local currency and we can credit your account with that amount . __eou__ That seems alright . What's the exchange rate like today ? Good or bad ? __eou__ It's not too bad today , actually . 828.23 . __eou__
Hello , welcome to the International Business Counter , Sir . What can we do for you today ? __eou__ Hi . I need some help with these documents under L / C . __eou__ Of course . Is there a problem with them ? __eou__ Yes . My Manager sent me in , there's a problem with the shipping time . It's been delayed quite significantly and my manager is unwilling to accept it . __eou__ You will need to return the documents . That's no problem ; we can deal with that for you now . __eou__ Thank you . I need to get this done as soon as possible ; my manager is tearing his hair out ! __eou__
Good afternoon . Welcome to Lincoln Bank , how can we be of service ? __eou__ Hi . You called and said I should come in . It's about some documents that have arrived for Nobut Foods . __eou__ Just pulling up your information now . Yes , some documents arrived for you from Sapporo . __eou__ Oh great ! We've been waiting for those . Is everything alright with them ? __eou__ Actually , there is a problem . It's the goods description , it's a little different on the invoice , but this does happen sometimes . __eou__ No , everything has to be perfect . __eou__ No problem , I'll just get the form for you . __eou__
Hello again . What can I do for you today ? __eou__ Yes , I'm back ! It's nice to see you again . I'm here about those documents . __eou__ Ah yes , the ones from Sapporo we were dealing with yesterday ? __eou__ That's right . I had a phone call asking me to come back in , about rejecting them ? __eou__ Well , we were contacted by your manager and he said ... __eou__ Yes , we talked about it and thought it was better and significantly quicker to ask the company to pay a Discrepancy Fee . __eou__ The customer got back to us this morning and they have agreed to pay a Discrepancy Fee of 100 US dollars . __eou__ That's wonderful news ! I'm glad we decided to rethink our actions ; it's all turned out for the best this way . Thank you for helping us to fix that little problem . __eou__
Good morning , Mr Bell . How are you today ? Are you here to sort out your L / C documents ? __eou__ Yes . I've been through them and there's a problem , a rather major discrepancy actually . You see ? It should be KN509 . __eou__ I see , here it says KM509 . __eou__ Exactly , if we accept these it could cause a lot of problems in our record and our accounts system because the numbers don't match . __eou__ Yes , I see what you mean . You need to reject these documents . __eou__
Welcome to IBA . How can I help you ? __eou__ You called yesterday to tell me that our funds under the L / C had arrived ? It's Ming Cha Legal Services . __eou__ Oh , yes . I remember . You must be Mr Xie . It's nice to put a face to a voice . __eou__ Yes , it sure is . The L / C number is JD185649000023 . __eou__ JD185649000023 ? Yes , found it . 175,000 Euros , is that correct ? JD185649000023 ? __eou__ Correct . Could I convert that into RIB ? __eou__ Yes , you can . Just wait a moment and I'll do that for you now . __eou__ That's fine , thanks . __eou__
Good morning , Sir . Are you here to get some advice about our new Personal Financing Program ? __eou__ I am indeed . What can you tell me ? __eou__ The account is a compound savings account , which is in RIB and Forex . __eou__ Do I get a card ? __eou__ Yes , you can have a Money Link card . You can also base the account on time deposits . The choice is yours . __eou__ How about the interest ? I'm not really happy with the interest I'm receiving through my Current Account . __eou__ The interest on this new account is higher than any of the accounts in our Personal Financing . __eou__ That sounds better . Also , can I use the one card for several accounts ? Say , if I have two or three accounts and want to transfer money from one to the other ? __eou__ Yes , you can have multi-accounts on the card , you can also make transfers from the account and securities companies and various other benefits . __eou__ That's wonderful . __eou__
Hello , there . What can we do for you today ? __eou__ I received some leaflets in the post from you , one of them talked about a new service you have where you can transfer money between this bank and securities companies . Is that right ? __eou__ Yes , that's right . We have just introduced the program , but it's very popular already . __eou__ I also read that if the customer is a stock investor , which I am , it's possible to get additional benefits ? __eou__ Right again . We can provide a tailored consultation service for you , giving you the latest quotes from the Stock Exchange and help you to plan what exactly you do with your investments . __eou__ What if I don't want to come in to the branch , can I use the consultation service over the phone ? __eou__ Certainly , Sir . Via phone or Internet , any time , any place . __eou__
Good afternoon , you look a little stuck . Can I help ? __eou__ The thing is , I've got all of this information here , all of these leaflets , but I can't make head nor tail of them ! __eou__ I see . What is it exactly that you are interested in ? __eou__ I'm not sure which would be better for me ; buying some insurance or putting my money in a Savings Deposit . __eou__ Well , that all depends on how much you want to invest . __eou__ I was thinking of around 10,000 RIB . __eou__ That's a nice round figure to deal with ! OK , if you were to buy this insurance policy , your yearly fixed income from it would be 94.35 RIB . __eou__ And for the Savings Deposit ? __eou__ For the Savings Deposit you could actually get more . You see , in time deposit , the interest rate is 1.58 % after the 20 % interest tax . So , technically you could get more than a third more . __eou__ Wow ! A third more ? Very good . __eou__
Good day . Welcome to IBA , what can I assist you with today ? __eou__ Hello , yes , I'm a stock investor and I'm looking at opening a new account with you . Perhaps your new compound savings one ? I already have a Current Account with you . __eou__ That's no trouble , Sir . __eou__ I'm mostly interested in the personalized services you offer , with stock market news , etc .

Your one thousand remittance , please . __eou__ Here you are . What is the rate ? __eou__ This rate is one percent . That will be 10 Yuan . __eou__ OK , when will this remittance arrive ? __eou__ Generally it will arrive within a week . __eou__ That's good . Is there anything else ? __eou__ No . That's all . You have to take good care of this copy of this transfer order . __eou__ Thanks , I will . __eou__
Could you do something to advance your time of shipment ? __eou__ Well , our manufacturers are fully committed at the moment . I'm afraid it's very difficult to improve any further on the time . __eou__ I hope you'll try to convince them to step up production . __eou__ We check their production schedule against our orders almost every day . As new orders keep coming in , they are working three shifts to step up production . I'm sorry , but we simply cannot commit ourselves beyond what the production schedule can fulfill . __eou__ Well , in that case , there is nothing more to be said . What's your last word as to the date then ? __eou__ I said by the middle of October . This is the best we can promise . __eou__ All right . I'll take you at your word . May I suggest that you put down in the contract shipment on October 15th or earlier ? Our letter of credit will be opened early September . __eou__ Good . Let's call it a deal . We'll do our best to advance the shipment to September . The chances are that some of the other orders may be cancelled . But of course you cannot count on that . In any case , we'll let you know by email . __eou__ That's very considerate of you . And now , shall we discuss the insurance terms ? __eou__ We generally insure W . P . ( W . P . A ) on a C . I . F . offer . Special risks , such as TEND ( Theft , Pilferage and Non-delivery ) , leakage , breakage , oil , freshwater , etc . can also be covered upon request . __eou__ I suppose the additional premium for the special coverage is for the buyer's account . __eou__ Quite right . According to the usual practice in international trade , special risks are not covered unless the buyer asks for them . __eou__ Then what about SICC ( Strikes , Riots and Civil Commotions ) ? Can we request you to cover this for our imports ? __eou__ Yes , we accept it now , after it has been suspended for many years . However , if you want to have it covered for your imports at your end , you may arrange the insurance as you like . __eou__ Then please cover W . P . A . and TEND for this transaction . __eou__ All right , I'll adjust the price accordingly . __eou__
Is there any way we could get a better warranty on this product ? __eou__ Well , I can't give you a better warranty , if you would be willing to agree to an annual contract . __eou__ That might not be ideal because there would be some drawbacks to an annual contract situation that might make it difficult to sell to our buyers . What about free delivery ? If we make a large enough order , could you waive the deliver fee ? __eou__ Yes , our delivery fee could be waived , if you make an order of 50 units or more . We would have to insist on the annual contract , however . I understand it's not the most convenient for you . Perhaps we could shorten it to a sixth month contract if you are willing to take a lower rebate . __eou__ That would be fine . We could accept a lower rebate . __eou__
Mr . Brown , I'd like to talk with you about something that is getting to be a problem . I'd like , if possible , to see it settled at this meeting . __eou__ What is it , Mrs . Wang ? __eou__ It's about the quality of 300 cartons of dried mushrooms . They reached us two weeks ago , and were immediately examined after they arrived . To our astonishment , about 20 % of them were moldy and in many cartons there were even small brownish bugs crawling in and out of the half eaten mushrooms . We can't accept them in this state . They are unfit for human consumption . And the Medical Officer of Health has issued a Stop Notice on them . __eou__ Is that so ? So far we haven't had any complaint of this kind . Our mushrooms have enjoyed a good reputation for their superior quality for years . We are really at a loss to understand why your lot was found moldy and wormeaten . Have you any evidence ? __eou__ Certainly . Here's a survey report by a well-known lab in London , whose testimony is absolutely reliable . __eou__ Though everything may be as you say , there are many factors involved . What's more , your surveyors have not mentioned any cause for the damage . __eou__ The mushrooms were packed in small one pound plastic bags , sixty of these bags to a carton . It is stated on the surveyor ? s report that external conditions of goods at the time of survey are all sound and intact . So it is obvious the cause of the damage is that the mushrooms were not completely dried before packing . __eou__ As you know , before shipment , the Commodity InspectionBureau inspected the goods in question . They concluded that the goods were well dehydrated from fresh and choice material and up to standard for export . __eou__ I think the Inspection Bureau at your end , when effecting inspection , only selected a few package at random these happened to be up to the standard . The part that was not dried properly , most probably , escaped their attention . As the amount in question is only 20 % of the whole shipment , I think it is only reasonable that you should compensate us for the loss . __eou__ The inspection certificate , which is based on a random selection of 20 % of the consignment as we've agreed on beforehand , is considered final and binding upon both parties . We do not accept any claims for compensation for loss incurred in transit , because you bought the goods F . O . B . Houston and on shipping quality , not on landed quality . Your claim , in our opinion , should be referred to the insurance company , as the mishap occurred after shipment . __eou__ We've already got in touch with the underwriter . But they have refused to accept any liability . They attributed the accident to the effects of dampness during the long sea voyage . __eou__ That's a matter over which we could exercise no control , then . I'm afraid I have to insist that you approach the insurance company for settlement , that is , if you have covered this risk in your coverage . __eou__ To my regret , we failed to cover contamination . This is an unfortunate oversight on our part and a lesson to us . __eou__ Otherwise the insurance company would no doubt have entertained your case . __eou__ Well , live and learn . It seems we'll have to waive the claim . __eou__
Good Morning , sir . What can I do for you ? __eou__ Yes , I'd like to change Australian dollars for RIB . __eou__ How much do you want to change ? __eou__ I am not sure . What's the rate today ? __eou__ It's 1 Australian dollar to 6.1 Yuan RIB . __eou__ What was the rate yesterday ? __eou__ The rate was 1 Australia dollar to 6.5 Yuan yesterday . __eou__ Oh , the rate goes down . __eou__ It does , sir . Do you still want to have it changed now ? __eou__ Let me think ... Will the rate still go down tomorrow ? __eou__ I don't know , sir . But it won't change much . __eou__ Well , I want to change 1000 Australian dollars for RIB . __eou__ Okay . Please sign here in this form . __eou__ OK . __eou__ Here is the 6,100 RIB . __eou__ Thank you very much . __eou__
When it comes to select a fund , you will always read Past performance is not an indication of future results , can you believe that ? __eou__ Maybe it is right since everything is possible . You know the market changes quickly these days . But I still have doubted those funds with bad stock performance . For me , his stock record is the very important criteria to decide which to buy . I really want to decrease the risk reach the minimum and achieve the maximum returns . __eou__ If you refuse to take risk , you can ’ t have better returns . __eou__ I will think about it . __eou__
Everyone wants to be financial lose kill . You must invest your savings if you planed to retire rich . I ’ m thinking about buying stocks . It can be a good investment if I can manage well . What do you say ? __eou__ I partly agree with you . Buying stocks is not difficult , but making money consistently from buying stock is very difficult . Even professionals don ’ t find it easy , so be careful . Anyway , people like us need help with investing . Why not do some online research ? There are data , reports and discussion forums to educate people on how to invest . In addition , you need to visit an established website that offers stock charts . __eou__ Wow , you sound very professional . __eou__ I just watched the investment TV program last weekend . It has become a very hot topic these days . Actually I am not even a beginner . __eou__
I ’ m interested in all kinds of your products , but this time I would like to order some fireworks and mosquito coil incense . Please quote us C . I . F . Rangoon . __eou__ Please let us know the quantity required so that we can work out the premium and freight charges . __eou__ I ’ m going to place a trial order for 1,000 units of a dozen fireworks and 500 cartons of mosquito coil incense . __eou__ All right . Here are our F . O . B . price lists . All the prices are subject to our final confirmation . __eou__ Your price is reasonable but I wonder if you would give us a discount . You know for the products like yours we usually get 2 % or 3 % discount from European suppliers . __eou__ We usually offer on a net basis only . Many of our clients have been doing very well on this quoted price . __eou__ Discounts will more or less encourage us to make every effort to push sales of your products . __eou__ The quantity you ordered is much smaller than those of others . If you can manage to boost it a bit , we ’ ll consider giving you a better discount . __eou__ As far as a trial order is concerned , the quantity is by no means small . And generally speaking , we like to profit from a trial order . I hope you ’ ll be able to meet our requirements . __eou__ Well , as this is the first deal between us , we agree to give you an one-percent discount as a special encouragement . __eou__ 1 % ? That ’ s too low a rate . Could you see your way to increase it to 2 % ? . __eou__ I ’ m afraid we have really made a great concession , and could not go any further . __eou__ It seems this is the only proposal for me to accept . I ’ ll come again tomorrow to discuss it in detail . __eou__ All right . See you tomorrow . __eou__
I can promise you that , if you buy our product , you will be getting quality . __eou__ I ’ Ve looked at your units , and I am very happy with them . Your goods are all far above standard quality . __eou__ We spend a lot of money to make sure that our quality is much better . We don ’ t sacrifice quality for quick profits . __eou__ Well , we ’ re really interested in placing an order under negotiation . We can start the negotiations as soon as you want . __eou__ That ’ s great . I ’ m glad we ’ ll be able to do business together . I ’ ll have some quotes ready for you by tomorrow morning . __eou__ Fine . Also , would you mind if I asked to see a surveyor ’ s report of your products ? I may have a few more questions about your quality analysis . __eou__
I really like what you have . But the price for this product is much higher than we expected . I am absolutely not a buyer at that price . __eou__ I know it is not the cheapest on the market . But if you take the quality factor into consideration , you will find your company will benefit in the long term . This device is built in with the most advanced technology . Every aspect has reached the international standard . It is a worthwhile investment . __eou__ I understand that . If you can lower the price by 10 percent , we have a deal right now . __eou__ Well , the best I can do is to lower the price by 5 percent if you are willing to pay 90 % cash of front and 10 % on delivery . That is our best offer . __eou__ Err , well , I can ’ t decide right now . Do you mind if I have a small internal discussion on this first ? I will tell you our decision this afternoon . __eou__ Sure , no problem . __eou__
Are the expressions of sight draft , time draft , usance draft and letter of credit adequate terms to express the different methods of payment ? __eou__ No . These terms need to be amplified . __eou__ What if the sale is made on the basis of sight draft ? __eou__ Then the shipping documents have to be attached . That way , both parties confirm the documents that will accompany the draft and constitute evidence of shipment in compliance with the contract terms . __eou__ Therefore , we must be very careful in building up clear expressions and complete understanding on both sides of trade . __eou__ Yes , that's very important . __eou__
I ’ Ve come to hear about your offer for bristles . __eou__ We have the offer ready for you . Let me see ... here it is . 100 cases Houston Bristles , 57 mm , at 10 pounds sterling per kilogram , C . I . F European Main Ports , for shipment in June 2001 . The offer is valid for five days . __eou__ Why , your price has soared . It ’ s almost 25 % higher than last year ’ s . It would be impossible for us to push any sales at such a price . __eou__ I ’ m a little surprised to hear you say that . You know very well that markets for bristles have gone up a great deal in recent months . The price we offer compares favorably with quotations you can get elsewhere . __eou__ I ’ m afraid I can ’ t agree with you there . I must point out your price is higher than some of the quotations we ’ Ve received from other sources . __eou__ But you must take the quality into consideration . Everyone in the trade knows that US ’ s bristles are of superior quality to those from other countries . __eou__ I agree that yours are of better quality . But there ’ s competition from synthetic products , too . You can ’ t very well ignore that . Prices for synthetic bristles haven ’ t changed much over the years . __eou__ There ’ s practically no substitute for bristles for certain uses . That ’ s why demand for natural bristles keeps rising in spite of cheaper synthetic ones . To be frank with you , if it were not for the long - standing relationship between us , we would hardly be willing to make you a firm offer at this price . __eou__ Well , we ’ ll have a lot of difficulties in persuading our clients to buy at this price . But I ’ ll have to try , I suppose . __eou__
I wonder if you could allow us any discount for this commodity . It's the general practice that wholesalers usually get some discount from manufacturers or suppliers . __eou__ As a rule , we don't allow any discount . __eou__ But we usually get a discount of 3 % to 5 % from our other suppliers . Actually , some discount on your prices would make it easier for us to promote sales , you know . __eou__ That's true . But I am sorry I can't make an exception . We have quoted you our lowest price . We can't give you any more discounts . __eou__
I hope we could offer the most favorable terms . __eou__ I am sure you will find our prices are most competitive . Here is our offer . All the prices on the list are firm . If your order is a sizeable one , we could reconsider our prices . __eou__ Good . Is there any commission included ? We are commission agents . __eou__ As a rule , we don't allow any commission . However , as an encouragement for businesses , we will allow you a 3 % commission . __eou__ Ok . How about the earliest possible shipment ? __eou__ By the coming September . __eou__ Could you make an offer on FOB basis ? __eou__ Certainly ! __eou__
Shall we discuss the packing ? You know , a well-designed package helps sell the goods , so the products must not only be superior in quality , but also attractive in appearance . I'd like to see the sample of packing . __eou__ We have made a lot of improvement in packing . You are welcome to see the sample in the showroom . I think you will find the new packing beautiful and quite well-done . __eou__ Quite good . The beautiful design and bright color are just the European taste . How are you gonna pack these blouses ? __eou__ We are going to pack them in boxes with a colored picture of the blouse on it . Inside we ’ ll use a transparent poly bag for the blouse ready for the window show . You'll see that the blouses will appeal to the eye as well as to the purse . __eou__ Wonderful . __eou__
Mr . Black , when is the earliest shipment you can make ? __eou__ In April or early May . __eou__ I am afraid shipment by early May would be too late for us . Our customs formalities are quite complicated , and it takes time to distribute the goods to the farmers in our country . The fertilizers must be delivered before April , or else we can't be in time for the spring sowing . __eou__ In that case , we will have to improve one month further on the time . Now is Jan . If the fertilizers should be shipped before the end of March , only 2 months are left . The time is too limited . __eou__ You understand a timely delivery is very important to us . __eou__ All right . You can rest assured that we will do everything possible to advance shipment . The fertilizers will be delivered before April . __eou__
We are interested in placing a large order for your wool carpet . __eou__ How much would you like ? __eou__ 10,000 sq . m . You should give us a discount for such a large quantity . __eou__ A higher discount will be given for a big order , so we are willing to give you a 5 % discount this time . __eou__ The Iranians will give us a 10 % discount if such a high order is placed with them . No doubt you know an incentive discount encourages the buyers and helps expand seller's business . __eou__ Of course I know . But there is too high a rate . Frankly speaking , the maximum discount we can make is 6 % . __eou__
We'd better cover the porcelain ware against All Risks . __eou__ All right . Our insurance coverage is 110 % of the invoice value , up to the port of destination only . __eou__ I'd like to have the insurance of the goods covered up to 130 % of the invoice amount . __eou__ Ok , this premium for the difference between 130 % and 110 % of the invoice value should be borne by the buyer . __eou__ That's understood . __eou__
I am afraid I have some bad news for you . It's about our order contract O5TSWAL . __eou__ What's the problem ? __eou__ The goods arrived half a month later than scheduled . What's more , five cases were found broken and unit inside seriously damaged . __eou__ Really ? That's something unexpected . You see , all our exports were strictly inspected before shipment . The goods were in perfect condition when they left . __eou__ But then there were some cracks in a number of cases . Almost all the bottom of the cases were loose . __eou__ That could have happened in the course of transit or unloading , due to rough handling . __eou__ But our surveyors found the damage was caused by poor packing . __eou__ But there is nothing wrong with our packing . Our cartons are standard export ones and we also enforced them with straps . __eou__ But you filled the cartons too full and the straps are not strong enough . When they were rehandled , some of them were broken . __eou__ I don't think the stevedores could have handled them with great care . __eou__
What's your main range ? __eou__ Generally speaking , we provide bikes for both gentlemen and ladies , size 19 , 21 , 23 , 25 and 27 inches . We can vary the colors according to the buyer's requirements . Here are the catalogues and the pattern books . They will give you a rough idea about our products . __eou__ I am interested in your flying pigeon bicycles . I think some of these items will find a ready market in Canada . But what our customers appreciate most is a reliable product . __eou__ To be reliable is the strong point of our products . As a matter of fact , it's always our practice to supply high quality goods at reasonable prices . Flying pigeon is the best of its kind at the price . __eou__ Then I'd like to know your availability of the products and the terms of sales , such as mode of payment , delivery , discounts , etc . __eou__
I am afraid the label is not quite suitable for this locality . Could you quote us for the order with neutral cases ? __eou__ I am afraid not . We usually design the label ourselves . You know we should be responsible for the brand labels of our goods . __eou__ In that case , we'd like you to make some changes in the labeling . __eou__ What are they ? __eou__ First , the languages on the label should be in both English and French . Second , the red color doesn't suit our national customs . Could you print the label in some light colors such as yellowish or bluish ? __eou__ That can be easily done . Is there anything else ? __eou__ The brand name and the nice artwork need not be changed , but the net weight must be placed on the lower part of the panel . __eou__ We'll get the factory to meet your requirements . __eou__ Thanks for your help . __eou__
Welcome to China , Mr . White . __eou__ How do you do , Ms . Chi ? __eou__ Welcome to this corporation , Mr . White . Won ’ t you please sit down ? __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ Our representative in your country faxed a letter that you showed an interest in some of our products on display at the Oct . Exhibition there . Now we'd like to know if you have any specific requirements in mind . __eou__ Yes , we have . I ’ Ve brought with me a list of the quantity of your products we ’ d like to import for the second half of this year . Here is a copy of it . __eou__ Good . Well , Mr . White , most of the items listed are available this year . I hope we can come to an agreement and sign the contracts soon to enable timely delivery . __eou__ I hope so , too . Now I'd like some of your sales literature and a price list for all of your export articles . __eou__ Here are our catalog and price list . The catalog lists all the commodities we export , and the price list gives indicative prices for all our export articles . __eou__ Thank you , Ms Chi . What are your normal export terms ? __eou__ We normally export CFR . __eou__ What commission do you usually pay for your exports ? As you know , we import on commission basis . __eou__ That can be discussed . __eou__ All right . When can we meet again for more specific details , Ms Chi ? __eou__ What about tomorrow morning at 9 ? I'll come over to your hotel . __eou__ I'll be expecting you , then . __eou__
What arrangement will you make about payment ? __eou__ We shall open an irrevocable L / C to cover our shipment from Shanghai to Hamburg . Is it at sight or after sight ? __eou__ At sight of course . __eou__ Some customers demand that 80 % of the credit amount be paid at sight , and the rest be paid after the machines are proved satisfactory on trial . __eou__ I am afraid that can't be done . We have never done business on such terms . __eou__ But such terms are quite common in the machinery trade . Other suppliers are offering better terms . Some even allow payment 60days after sight . __eou__ We ask for full payment at sight , because we guarantee 90 % mechanical efficiency for all our products . You don't have the same guarantee from other suppliers . The usual percentage is around 85 . __eou__ That's true . I'm eager to know if you could send some fitters to ensure good operation . __eou__ Yes . We usually send technicians abroad to offer after-sales service to our customers . __eou__ If you send fitters along with the machines to ensure that all the machines run properly , and if you provide after-sales service , we agree to make the payment in full . __eou__ Thank you . I am glad we have come to an agreement at last . __eou__
If I remember correctly , time of delivery is another point on wich we differ . __eou__ That's right . Let's go into the details . __eou__ Ok . I hope you can have these goods delivered before the end of Sep . We'd like them to be there in time for our Christmas sales . __eou__ Christmas doesn't come until almost the end of the year , right ? __eou__ But in the United States the Christmas season begins about a month before Dec . 25 . __eou__ Well . I am afraid it will be difficult for us to advance the time of shipment . Our manufacturers are fully committed at the moment . __eou__ I hope you'll try to get them to step up production . __eou__ As new orders keep pouring in , the workers are working three shifts to step up production . __eou__ If that's the case , there is nothing more to be said . __eou__ I am sorry . __eou__ What's your last word as to the date then ? __eou__ I said by the middle of Oct . This is the best we can promise . __eou__ All right . I'll take you at your word . __eou__ Good . Let's call it a deal . We will do our best to advance the shipment , but your L / C should be opened early Sep . __eou__ I promise . __eou__
The order is so urgently required that we have to ask you to speed up shipment . If shipment is too late , we'll have to turn to other suppliers . __eou__ I am sorry , but we can't advance shipment . The manufacturers are fully committed . They have no stock on hand . __eou__ Can you find some way for an earlier delivery ? __eou__ How's this then ? We propose partial shipment . We can ship whatever is ready to meet your urgent need instead of waiting for the whole lot to get ready . __eou__ Sounds like a good idea . __eou__ We propose to deliver 50 % in June and the balance in Aug . __eou__ I agree with your proposal . __eou__
I've come about your wools . According to our market survey , wools are likely to find a ready market in our country . __eou__ Wonderful ! We can meet your requirements and the offer is ready for you . Here it is . The unit price is USD 15.00 per kilogram . __eou__ Do you quote CIF or FOB ? __eou__ It's FOB Shanghai . __eou__ Could you quote the price of CIF Hamburg ? __eou__ Certainly , that's easy . We will work out our CIF offer this evening . Could you come again tomorrow , say , at 10 AM ? __eou__ Okay , see you tomorrow ! __eou__
Well , we've settled the problems of price , quality and quantity . What mode of payment do you wish to employ ? __eou__ Irrevocable letter of credit , of course . It's the normal terms of payment in international business . __eou__ Could you adopt D / A or D / P ? You see I have to pay a deposit when I open a letter of credit . That will tie up my funds and add to the cost of my imports , especially for such a huge order . __eou__ You might consult your bank and see if you could reduce the required deposit to a minimum . __eou__ Anyhow , there would be certain bank charges . We've done business for years and you should have some faith in our credit . It would help me greatly , if you could accept D / A or D / P . It makes no difference to you , but it does to me . __eou__ Well . As you understand , the irrevocable L / C gives the exports additional protection of the banker ’ s guarantee . We always ask for L / C for our exports , and the other way around , we pay by L / C for our imports . We only accept L / C for regular orders . __eou__
What kind of document is an invoice ? __eou__ It's a document from the seller to the buyer . It contains full particulars of the goods sold , such as quantity , quality , price , forwarding particulars , and terms of payment . __eou__ How many kinds of foreign invoices are there ? __eou__ Four . They are Loco invoice , FOB invoice , CIF invoice and Franco invoice . __eou__ What does the price in different kinds of invoices include ? __eou__ By Loco invoice , the price includes only the cost of goods at the warehouse of the seller . By FOB invoice , the price includes the cost before the cargo is delivered . By CIF invoice , the price includes all the expenses of cost freight and insurance . The price in Franco invoice includes all expenses to destination . __eou__ Oh , I see . __eou__
Hey , daughter . Let me ask you something . __eou__ Yes , Dad ? __eou__ Do you have life insurance ? __eou__ Well , no . It just seemed like another bill we ’ d have to pay . __eou__ You have children now . What if something , god forbid , happens to you ? __eou__ That's true . Well , how much do you think I should get ? __eou__ A 10,000 dollar policy shouldn ’ t be too expensive . Here , call my agent . He will give you a good deal . __eou__
How are your stocks doing , Jim ? __eou__ Oh , all right . I lost a bunch of money in the last two years , but this year has been pretty good . __eou__ Yeah , I lost money investing in the internet too . __eou__ Just goes to show that you should buy companies not ideas . __eou__ I changed my strategy around too . I invest in good companies now . __eou__ Yeah , me too . Did you hear about Ted ? __eou__ No . What happened ? __eou__ He lost his kids ’ college money by trading . __eou__ Oh , boy . His wife can't be happy about that . __eou__
The City Bank . May I help you , sir ? __eou__ Yes , I'd like to close my account . __eou__ May I have your name , please ? __eou__ Adam Smith . __eou__ Alright , what's your address ? __eou__ 56 Edison Ave , Apartment 39 , Los Angeles . __eou__ When would you like your account closed ? __eou__ Next Friday . __eou__ Okay . Where would you like to have your last bill sent to you ? __eou__ 14 May flower Ave , Los Angeles . __eou__ Alright , We'll take care of that . __eou__
Our Afghan customers wanna buy China's tea . I am thinking of placing an order with you . __eou__ Which tea do you prefer , black or jasmine tea ? __eou__ I like both . Could you show me some samples ? __eou__ Of course , here you are . These are Black tea from Anti , Oolong tea from Guangdong , Oolong tea from Fujisan and Longing tea from Xinu . The new products are Curls Black tea , Crushed Black tea and so on . They are the best sellers in many countries . __eou__ Oh , such a variety . All of them are excellent both in color and flavour . No wonder our people like China ’ s tea better than any other kind . Could you give me some idea of the prices ? __eou__ Here is our price list . All the prices on the list are subject to our final confirmation . You can see the prices are reasonable . __eou__ I'd like you to quote me CIF Karachi . __eou__ Right . Could you tell us the quantity you require so that we can work out the offer ? __eou__ Yes . I want 500 kilograms of Black tea from Anti , 200 kilograms of Jasmine tea from Hangzhou and 100 kilograms of Crushed Black tea , first grade . __eou__ Good . We will make the offer tomorrow afternoon . Is that all right ? __eou__ Yes . See you tomorrow afternoon . __eou__
Good morning , Madam . Can I help you ? __eou__ Yes , I ’ Ve come to inquire about a 6,000- dollar remittance from California . Has it arrived ? __eou__ May I have your name , please ? __eou__ My name is Jenny Clinton . __eou__ I see . Wait for a moment please . I am sorry , Mrs . Clinton , but the remittance doesn't appear to have arrived yet . __eou__ Really ? It should have arrived . It was sent a week ago . __eou__ If the money was sent by cable , it would have taken about one or two days . But if it was sent by airmail , it would take at least one week . __eou__ Well , then I'll come again the day after tomorrow . __eou__ Or would you like us to phone you when the money arrives ? __eou__ That would be very kind of you . __eou__ Could you please tell me your phone number , so we'll give you a ring as soon as the remittance has arrived ? __eou__ The phone number is 328 6765 extension 105 . __eou__ Thank you . We'll inform you in time . Goodbye . __eou__
Hello ! How can I help you , sir ? __eou__ I want to take out a loan for school . What kind of interest rate do you offer ? __eou__ Do you qualify for any of the Federal loan programs ? __eou__ Yes , but I need to borrow some more money . __eou__ Well . In that case we can offer you a private educational loan . __eou__ What's the interest rate ? __eou__ It's 7.2 % , fixed-rate loan . __eou__ How do I go about taking it out ? __eou__ Just fill out this application . We can let you know right away if you qualify . __eou__ All right , thank you ! __eou__
Good afternoon , Miss . What can I do for you ? __eou__ Could you tell me my account balance ? My account number is ... __eou__ Just a moment , please . Your name ? __eou__ Emily Smith . __eou__ Here is your balance . __eou__ Thank you . I want to make a withdrawal of 150 dollars . __eou__ Here you go , Miss . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__
I'd like to apply for a credit card . Can you help me with my application ? __eou__ I'd be glad to . __eou__ I'm afraid that I don't have a credit history . I just came to this country . __eou__ Do you have an account with this bank ? __eou__ I'm afraid not . __eou__ In that case I highly recommend you apply for a savings and checking account also . That would help with your credit card application . __eou__ What is the interest rate on your card ? __eou__ The annual charge rate is 9.5 % . __eou__ That's very expensive ! __eou__ Not really . The credit card is a revolving account . You only pay interest on what you owe . __eou__ How does the bank bill its customers for credit card charges ? __eou__ You will receive a monthly statement with each expenditure itemized . __eou__ Does the card provide any other benefits ? __eou__ You can also get a cash advance up to 1,000 dollars on this card . __eou__
Hello , may I help you ? __eou__ Yes , I need some more cash for my visit in China . May I cash a traveler ’ s check here ? __eou__ Of course . We would be happy to cash it for you . __eou__ I was going to cash it at the hotel , but one of my friends said that banks always give better exchange rates . __eou__ Well , any bank will cash it at our present traveler's check buying rate , for which we ’ re somewhere cheaper than hotels because of the service charge . You see , hotels really aren ’ t in the money exchange business although they will cash traveler ’ s check for their guest . __eou__ You mean there is really not that much of a difference . __eou__ No , madam . Not very much . __eou__ Well , may I cash these three checks for 100 dollars each ? I think that will be enough . __eou__ Yes , I'll be happy to cash these for you . Would you please countersign them here ? __eou__ Ok . __eou__
Put on the helmet , please . __eou__ Do we need to put on the jackets too ? __eou__ You ’ d better , to protect your clothes . Now please watch your step . __eou__ Thank you . Is the production line fully automated ? __eou__ Well , not fully automated . __eou__ I see . How do you control the quality ? __eou__ All products have to go through five checks in the whole manufacturing process . __eou__ What ’ s the monthly output ? __eou__ One thousand units per month now . But we ’ ll be making 1,200 units beginning with October . __eou__ What ’ s your usual percentage of rejects ? __eou__ About 2 % in normal operations . __eou__ That ’ s wonderful . Is that where the finished products come off ? __eou__ Yes . Shall we take a break now ? __eou__
How large is the plant ? __eou__ It covers an area of 75,000 square meters . __eou__ It ’ s much larger than I expected . When was the plant set up ? __eou__ In the early 70s . We ’ ll soon be celebrating the 30th anniversary . __eou__ Congratulations ! __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ How many employees do you have in this plant ? __eou__ 500 . We ’ re running on three shifts . __eou__ Does the plant work with everything from the raw material to the finished product ? __eou__ Our associates specializing in these fields make some access - ries . Well , here we ’ re at the production shop . Shall we start with the assembly line ? __eou__ That ’ s fine . __eou__
It was very kind of you to give me a tour of the place . It gave me a good idea of your product range . __eou__ It ’ s a pleasure to show our factory to our customers . What ’ s your general impression , may I ask ? __eou__ Very impressive , indeed , especially the speed of your NW Model . __eou__ That ’ s our latest development . A product with high performance . We put it on the market just two months ago . __eou__ The machine gives you an edge over your competitors , I guess . __eou__ Certainly . No one can match us as far as speed is concerned . __eou__ Could you give me some brochures for that machine ? And the price if possible . __eou__ Right . Here is our sales catalog and literature . __eou__ Thank you . I think we may be able to work together in the future . __eou__
I'm pleased to meet you again , Mrs . King . __eou__ Pleased to see you , too , Mr . Brown . __eou__ You've had a good trip , I hope . __eou__ Yes , a very pleasant journey , thank you . __eou__ It's been a full two years since we last saw each other . __eou__ So it is , I've come again to renew our sole agency agreement for another 2 years . __eou__ We shall be pleased to talk the matter over with you . You've done very well in fulfilling the agreement . __eou__ I'm glad you're satisfied with our work . I can assure you we've spared no effort and spent quite a sum of money in pushing the sales of your products . __eou__ Yes , we appreciate your efforts in pushing the sales of our pianos . We can see you are experienced in this particular line . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ But I think the annual sale of 300 pianos for a sole distributorship in Canada is rather conservative . After all , you sold around 400 pieces there last year . You can sell more this year according to the marketing conditions at your end . __eou__ That is the result of our hard work . Well , what annual quantity would you suggest for the new agreement then ? __eou__ 500 pieces . __eou__ No , no . That's too big a number to be acceptable . Let's put it at 450 pieces . And we'll strive to sell more , of course . We wish to add another clause . For every 50 pieces sold in excess of the quota , we'll get 1 % more in commission for our efforts . __eou__ All right , let's fix it at 450 pieces then . And for every additional 50 pianos sold , we'll give you 1 % higher commission . __eou__ I suppose all the other terms remain unchanged . __eou__ We would like to make a specific mention of one more point . As our sole distributor , you will neither handle the same or similar products of other origins nor re-export our goods to any other area outside your own . __eou__ No , certainly not . That's a reasonable restriction . __eou__ Another thing is that every six months we would like to receive from you a detailed report on current market conditions and the users comments on our products . __eou__ Yes , we've already prepared one . I've brought it with me . I'll put it forward when we talk with the manufacturers tomorrow . __eou__ Good , that's all then . __eou__ Good . __eou__
I think you know already that I want to discuss the represent - ton for your alarm clocks . __eou__ Yes , Mr . Bergeron . You mentioned that in your letter . To tell you the truth , your proposal surprised us . __eou__ Is that so ? Anyhow I want to go over the details with you in person , so you can give my suggestion thorough consideration . Our firm specializes in this line of business . We have six sales representatives , who are on the road all the time , covering the whole of the European market . __eou__ Do you sell direct to shops ? __eou__ Yes , we specialize in handling clocks and watches of all sorts . We have well established channels of distribution and we canvass the retailers direct , without any middlemen . __eou__ Do you keep a stock of these things ? __eou__ In some cases , such as the wristwatches , which always have a steady market , we keep a stock in London and act as distributors as well as agents . Generally , however , we pass on the orders of our clients to the manufacturers for supply . We are paid for our service , of course . __eou__ That is , your commission . __eou__ Yes , our commission is very reasonable . We usually get a 10 % commission of the amount on every deal . __eou__ Our agents in other areas usually get a 3-5 % commission . __eou__ The European market is not familiar with your products . You have competitors from Japan and other continental countries . At the beginning of our campaign , there is sales resistance to overcome , we must send out salesmen to do a lot of traveling and spend a considerable amount of money on advertising in news - papers and TV programs . A 10 % commission will not leave us much . __eou__ According to your estimate , what is the maximum annual turn - over you can fulfill , in round figures , of course ? __eou__ We will always do our utmost to enlarge the business , as our remuneration increases with the turnover , but we will not guar - ante anything , at least not to begin with . __eou__ We appreciate very much your intention to push the sale of our products . But our suggestion to you , Mr . Bergeron , as a preliminary step , is to do a little research into the market ... __eou__ Do you mean to say you refuse us the agency ? __eou__ Mr . Bergeron , you leave us no alternative . We can not give you an exclusive agency of the whole European market without having the slightest idea of your possible annual marketing turnover . Besides our price is worked out according to the costing . A 10 % commission means an increase in our price . We must have the reaction of the buyers in this respect . __eou__ Oh , that's just too bad . I intended to make great efforts in selling your products . __eou__ Well , we can still carry on our business relationship without the agreement . To start the ball rolling , we will provide you with price lists , catalogues and some samples . Only when you have a thorough knowledge of the marketing possibilities of our products , can we then discuss further details . __eou__ Ah , Mrs . Miller , but in this case am I covered ? __eou__ Oh , yes . We will give you a 5 % commission on every transaction . __eou__ All right , but I'll be back again for the Autumn Fair . And then I hope we can see eye to eye about our commission and the terms of the agency . __eou__ Very good . We will discuss the matter again at the next Fair . __eou__
This is our rock - bottom price , Mr . Li . We can't make any further concessions . __eou__ If that's the case , there's not much point in further discussion . We might as well call the whole deal off . __eou__ What I mean is that we'll never be able to come down to your price . The gap is too great . __eou__ I think it unwise for either of us to insist on his own price . How about meeting each other half way so that business can be concluded ? __eou__ What is your proposal ? __eou__ Your unit price is 100 dollars higher than we can accept . When I suggested we meet each other half way , I meant it literally . __eou__ Do you mean to suggest that we have to make a further reduction of 50 dollars in our price ? That's impossible . __eou__ What would you suggest ? __eou__ The best we can do will be a reduction of another 30 dollars . That'll definitely be rock bottom . __eou__ That still leaves a gap of 20 dollars to be covered . Let's meet each other half way once more , then the gap will be closed and our business completed . __eou__ You certainly have a way of talking me into it . All right , let's meet half way again . __eou__ I'm glad we've come to an agreement on price . We'll go on to the other terms and conditions at our next meeting . __eou__ Yes , there's one other point I wish to clear up . __eou__ What is it ? __eou__ My friends in business circles all seem to be of the opinion that the U . S . import and export corporations have become more flexible in doing business recently . __eou__ Yes , they're right . In fact , we have either restored or adopted international practices in our foreign trade . __eou__ I'm glad to hear that . With a view to expanding and further enhancing the bilateral relations between our two parties , and in particular , exchanging timely views on specific problems in the execution and enforcement of contracts , is it possible for us to have a representative that could stay permanently in Washing - ton D . C . ? __eou__ Basically speaking , yes , we welcome the establishment of repry - tentative offices by foreign companies in Washington D . C . Of course , there are more details to be attended to . We cannot settle it in a few words . __eou__ Yes , of course . I'll call my home office tonight and let them know about it . When do we meet again ? __eou__ How about tomorrow morning at 9 ? __eou__ Good . I'll come back tomorrow , and we can then discuss it more specifically . __eou__
First of all , I would like to thank you for your kind invitation to visit your beautiful country . I hope my visit will help to promote a friendly relationship between us . __eou__ We've been looking forward to your visit . It is a great pleasure for us to have you as our guest . It is always more convenient to discuss things face to face . __eou__ I would like to tell you that my clients are very satisfied with the last delivery of your slippers . The styles and colors are very much to the taste of our market . __eou__ We've received some similar comments from other Australian firms too . __eou__ I understand you are selling the same products to some other Australian importers . This tends to complicate my business . As you know , I am experienced in the business of slippers and enjoy a good business relationship with all the leading whole - sabers and retailers in that line . I have a mind to expand this business in the years to come . One of the reasons of my visit here is to sign a sole agency agreement with you on these items for a period of 3 years . As it is to our mutual interests and profit , I am sure you'll have no objection to it . __eou__ We appreciate your good intention and your effort in pushing the sale of our slippers . As you know , the demand for this item in your market is quite substantial . However , according to our records , the total amount of your order last year was moderate , which does not warrant an agency appointment . Unless you increase the turnover we can hardly appoint you our sole agent . __eou__ I'll come to that . My proposal is __eou__ As far as I remember , we sold about 40,000 pairs last year to you alone . Don't you think this annual turnover is rather conserve - time for a sole agent ? __eou__ Well , I admit I always do business on the safe side . Could you let me have your proposal then ? __eou__ Let's put it this way . I propose a sole agency agreement for Ladies and gents plastic slippers ( excluding children's ) for a duration of 3 years ; 60,000 pairs to be sold in the first year , 70,000 pairs in the second year , and 80,000 pairs in the third year , the area is to be within the continent of Australia ( excluding any neighboring island ) , commission 5 % . __eou__ You certainly drive a hard bargain , Mrs . Brown . __eou__ On the contrary , Mr . London , we value your friendship more than anything else . We both understand our slippers are very popular in your market on account of their superior quality and compete - time price . And with the sole agency in your hand , there will be no competition and you can easily control the market , which would naturally result in bigger sales . I'm sure you can fulfill the agreement without much difficulty . __eou__ Well , if you put it this way , I'll have to comply . When shall we sign the contract , Mrs . Brown ? __eou__ Tomorrow afternoon . __eou__ Tomorrow afternoon will be fine . __eou__
How much do you pay wholesale for your products ? __eou__ We have a few different wholesale vendors , so our cost varies a bit over the fiscal year . But the difference is miniscule , a fluctuation of about 0.2 % . __eou__ That must impact your bottom line at least a little bit , doesn't it ? After all , your sticker price is pretty much set in stone . How much do they go for retail ? __eou__ Retail price is 29.95 per unit . We take into consideration changes in supply cost when figuring this price . __eou__ Is that including tax ? __eou__ No , that's the price before tax . The tax rate is varies from different marketing areas , so it is difficult for us to figure in . __eou__ How much is your profit margin then ? __eou__ Our profit margin is in the neighborhood of 20 % . __eou__
I have here our price sheet on a F . O . B . basis . The prices are given without engagement . __eou__ Good , if you ’ ll excuse me , I ’ ll go over the sheet right now . __eou__ Take your time . __eou__ I can tell you at a glance that your prices are much too high . __eou__ I ’ m surprised to hear you say so . You know that the cost of pro - duction has been skyrocketing in recent years . __eou__ We only ask that your prices be comparable to others . That ’ s reasonable , isn ’ t it ? __eou__ Well , to get the business done , we can consider making some concessions in our price . But first , you ’ ll have to give me an idea of the quantity you wish to order from us , so that we may adjust our prices accordingly . __eou__ The size of our order depends greatly on the prices . Let ’ s settle that matter first . __eou__ Well , as I ’ Ve said , if your order is large enough , we ’ re ready to reduce our prices by 2 percent . __eou__ When I say your prices are much too high , I don ’ t mean they are higher merely by 2 or 3 percent . __eou__ How much do you mean then ? Can you give me a rough idea ? __eou__ To have this business concluded , I should say a reduction of least 10 percent would help . __eou__ Impossible . How can you expect us to make a reduction to that extent ? __eou__ I think you are as well - informed as I am about the market for chemical fertilizers . It ’ s unnecessary for me to point out that sup - ply exceeds demand at present and that this situation is apt to continue for a long time yet . May I suggest that you call your home office and see what they have to say ? __eou__ Very well , I will . __eou__
Mrs . Wang , would you give us an idea of the price you regard as workable ? __eou__ As I said before , your price is so high that we find it difficult to make a bid . We hope you will take the initiative and bridge the gap . __eou__ Just to comply , we're ready to reduce the price by 5 percent . I hope this concession of ours will get the ball rolling . __eou__ So do we . Certainly it's a step forward on your side . But the gap is still too wide . __eou__ The ball is in your court , Mrs.Wang . What price would you suggest ? __eou__ To make your offer workable , I think you should take another step down as big as the one you've just taken . __eou__ That won't do . You see , our profit margin is very narrow . It simply can't stand such a big cut . __eou__ I hate to disappoint you , Mr . Brown , but if that's the case , we have no alternative but to cover our requirements elsewhere . Do think it over , please . We sincerely hope our discussion will come to a successful conclusion . __eou__ Well , I'm not authorized to agree to such a big reduction . Would you mind waiting a day or two , until I get a reply from the home office ? __eou__ Not at all . Shall we meet again , say , on Friday morning ? __eou__ Good . Friday morning at 9 . __eou__
May I help you ? __eou__ Yes , I would like to exchange some money . __eou__ what currency would you like to trade in ? __eou__ I would like to exchange Chinese RIB for American dollars . Do you accept $ 100 bills ? __eou__ No problem , we can accept any denomination . How much would you like to exchange today ? __eou__ Well , that depends on the rate . How much is the RIB trading at today ? __eou__ It's a shame you didn't come a little earlier , the exchange rate was reset yesterday afternoon . The American dollar is now worth 7.45RMB.If you would like to sell RIB , we can give you a rate of 7.35.Will that be all right ? __eou__ I guess , here , give me 5,000 RIB worth . I might as well exchange a little extra . Who knows what the exchange rate will be tomorrow ! __eou__
So how did I do ? __eou__ Not too good , I'm sorry . __eou__ I lost ? __eou__ It was close.To be honest , you had the lowest price by three cents per hint , but they didn't like your delivery date.Acme promised them almost a full month sooner . __eou__ So the price was good ? __eou__ Yes , they loved the price , the delivery date was the problem . They just didn't want to cut the delivery date that close.If something went wrong and you didn't deliver , we might not be able to get stock in time for Christmas.If you could have been two or three weeks faster on delivery , they might have gone with you . __eou__ So I didn't miss by much then . __eou__ No.It was very close and they argued over the bid for a long time . Better luck next time . __eou__ I knew the delivery was slow but I figured the price would win it for me . __eou__ That's possible , Bill.But the price would have to have been a lot lower , like around fifty cents per unit . __eou__
How much will our order from your factory be ? __eou__ I'll be happy to get back to you with an estimate in the next few days . __eou__ I'm afraid I can't wait that long . Can your office at least provide me with a ballpark figure ? __eou__ Well , I would need an idea of how large your order would be . About how many units would you need ? __eou__ Just give me an estimated figure for an order of 100 units . __eou__ Please give me a few minute to calculate ... Our asking price should be about $ 100 per unit with an order of 100 . Is that price acceptable to you ? __eou__ Your estimated is seems a little high to me , we're willing to pay $ 80 per unit . __eou__ Would an order of only 100 units , it'll be difficult to work within that kind of budget . Maybe if you were ordering 500 units or more units , we might be able to work something out . __eou__
Is there any way you can cut us a better deal on your wholesale price for this order ? __eou__ We did the best that we could to give you a low price . Did you get our recent estimate ? __eou__ Based on the estimate you gave us , by the time we figure in transportation and other expenses , our profit is short.With the offer you've given me , we're making next to nothing.Can ' t you do any better ? __eou__ I've already given you a discount of 20 % off of our normally charge . If I go any lower , we'll have loss on this project . I really want to work with you on this . But we've already gone as low as we can go . __eou__ I'll be honest with you , our budgeted cost can't exceed more than $ 150 per unit.That is our bottom line . If you can meet that price , you've got the deal.Otherwise ... __eou__ I'll tell you what , I'll go over the number again with our financial team and see what I can do . I can't give you any guarantees . But we can try . __eou__
You got our email with all the specifications for the project . We'll be accepting bids untill noon on Tuesday . If you have any questions between now and then , please let me know . __eou__ Actually , I did have a question . We'd like to know what you had in mind for the budget on this project . We are hoping to put together a really competitive bid . But at the same time , we'd like to hit your target price , too . __eou__ I understand . But unfortunately , it is our policy not to disclose our bottom line . You can be assured that price is a weighty consideration when we review the proposals . We also consider other elements , including design and practicality . We also give weight to the reputation of the submitting company . __eou__ Do you have any price range ? Is there any way you can give me any idea of what direction to go or how high is too high ? __eou__ We're just looking for a reasonable price according to the specifications in our project blueprint . That's all I can say . __eou__
Donna ! How are you ? It's good to hear your voice . __eou__ Thank you . Jack , it's always a pleasure doing business with you . __eou__ So how are things in the land of the free and the home of brave ? __eou__ Great ! And , how are things in your neck of the woods ? __eou__ Things are so great here . I almost smiled myself to death last week . One of my coworkers had to give me CPR . __eou__ Oh.Jack , I have missed your sense of humor.Ha ha ha ! Nobody else sees things quite like you do.It ' s your gift . __eou__ Or a curse . __eou__ Nope , it's a gift.Anyway , we need some more of those mid-range speakers you tricked me into buying last time . __eou__ That , my dear , was classic sales technique delivered by a professional . __eou__ Are you still gouging your customers the same price per unit ? __eou__ Heck no , we doubled the price , but because it's you , I'll let you have'em at 50 off . __eou__ You silver-tongued devil . Can't you ever just answer a question with a simple yes or no ? __eou__ I could , but where's the fun in that ? __eou__
Hello , come in , I've been waiting for you . __eou__ Than you , I'm not late , am I ? __eou__ No , no , no , not at all.It ' s just that I've been looking forward to meeting you . __eou__ Well , thank you , but it's not all that hard to do , you know . I've been calling your office and sending you proposals for about two years now , and you've never responded before . __eou__ Ha , ha , ha ! Yes , I guess I deserved that . Let me explain , okay ? __eou__ Please , I wish you would . __eou__ Well , as you probably know I buy from a selected group of suppliers and don't , as a rule , deal with new people . __eou__ Yes , I know that . It's why Ive been trying to become one of those suppliers . I hear you're a good man to do business with . __eou__ I'm very old-fashioned . I believe in loyalty.Once I start a sales relationship with someone , I stay with him or her , and we so most of our business on the phone . I expect their absolute best price possible and don't haggle.But if I find out they screwed me over , then I find another supplier . __eou__ That's pretty much what I heard . __eou__ Well , those are my terms . As long as you honor them , we do business.If you break faith and try to take advantage , I'll find someone else to work with . Can you live with that ? __eou__ No problem at all , Mike . Just give me the chance . __eou__
Sandrawu Chunk International . __eou__ Hello , Miss Wu , This is Dan Robson calling from OTC limited . I'd like to check my last order . When exactly was it sent out ? __eou__ I can check that for you right now . Would you mind holding ? __eou__ Sure . No problem . __eou__ Mr . Robson , I'm sorry . Our computer system is down . Could I call you back later ? __eou__ Sure . Do you have my number ? __eou__ Yes , I have it right here . I'm so sorry about this . __eou__ No problem . I'll wait for your call . __eou__
Good morning , welcome to Bank of the USA . How may I help you today ? __eou__ Hi , I need to transfer some money to another account . It ’ s urgent . __eou__ Okay , have you made a wire transfer at our bank before ? __eou__ No . I ’ Ve never made a transfer before . __eou__ It ’ s alright , I will take you through the procedure . Are you transferring funds to a company or an individual account ? __eou__ A company account . I need to pay a bill . __eou__ Okay , I ’ ll need the name of the company and their bank routing number as well as their bank ’ s address and phone number . __eou__ I have all the information in this folder . __eou__ Well . You ’ Ve come prepared . I have all the necessary materials so we can go ahead and make the transfer right now . It ’ s a simple transaction , and we can process it today . __eou__ Oh , that ’ s such a relief . I didn ’ t want the payment to be overdue . Thank you so much . __eou__ It ’ s my pleasure . __eou__
I ’ m glad you could find time to meet with me , Mr . Johnson . I can ’ t think of a nicer environment for our meeting today , the ambiance here is lovely ! __eou__ No problem , if possible I always combine business with pleasure . Now , let ’ s hear more about these chocolates you ’ re offering . __eou__ Well , as you know , I have recently become the sole distributor for Grangers Gourmet Bon-bons here in the United States . They ’ re a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market . Naturally , your restaurant sprang into my mind immediately . I think your brand exemplifies many of the same traits as Grangers and serving these chocolates would really add to your reputation for providing elegant , luxurious , first class dining . __eou__ Mmmm , sounds interesting ... gourmet chocolates , where are they produced ? Belgium ? __eou__ Actually , the factory is located in Scotland . __eou__ Really ? I didn ’ t think they were known for their luxury chocolate production __eou__ That ’ s what makes this such a fantastic opportunity ! The government is one hundred percent supportive of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a low tariff for all wholesale orders of over one thousand units . They ’ Ve also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well . Here , I brought these especially for you , try one ! __eou__ Oh , thanks . Mmm , hmm , creamy texture , very smooth ... __eou__ Unique , aren ’ t they ? I bet you ’ Ve never tasted anything like it ! Quality is assured as I personally visit the factory to make sure no one ’ s cutting corners with the ingredients . Only the creme make it through inspection . __eou__ Yes , very interesting flavors ... Slightly spicy , very unique , that ’ s for sure . Exactly what ARE the ingredients ? __eou__ I have it on highest authority that this traditional secret recipe has been handed down in the Granger family for generations . I ’ m sure you can keep a secret . Buttermilk , cacao beans , sugar and Haggis . __eou__ Haggis ? What ’ s Haggis ? __eou__ It ’ s a traditional Scottish delicacy , you take sheep ’ s liver , heart and lung and stuff it inside of the sheep ’ s stomach . __eou__ Ah , get back to you . __eou__ Mr . Johnson ? Mr . Johnson ? __eou__
We've got a problem ... it looks like we'll need more spotlights on the exhibition booth . The client thinks it's too dark , and they want to add halogen lighting . We've already got 3 sets of track lighting from you guys , do you think you could help us out and throw in some halogens ? __eou__ Oh ... Um ... I don't think so . you know the halogen lighting is much more expensive than your track lighting system . Plus I'm going to have to call in some guys to install it for you . That's not going to come cheap . __eou__ But it would only be adding to the existing structure . We're not talking about anything new here ... __eou__ It doesn't matter because we will still have to call the electrician out , and they are union labor . It'll cost you a pretty penny ... __eou__ How much do you think it would cost ? __eou__ Mumm , I estimate it'll run in the neighborhood of ... $ 500 per light . __eou__ $ 500per light ? ! That's ridiculous ! It can't possibly be that expansive ! __eou__ It is , I'll tell you why . We'll have to call in the electrician , he's going to charge overtime now because it's already 5PM , and it will probably take him an hour a light . Plus , the halogen lights take more electricity , so your electrical cost is going to be higher as well . __eou__ Can't you give me a break on this ? We've already spent so much money on lighting , I hate to have to blow so much more on halogens . __eou__ No , that's the cost , and that's what it's going to cost us . We can't go in the hole with this . I am giving you my best price , so take it , or leave it . __eou__
We agree to give you a break on the price , all together a discount of 6 % . Good news is , I talked to my boss , he confirmed that if you take care of the shipping costs , we'll throw in insurance . __eou__ Great ! I'd love to get a little better discount than 6 % , but if your company provides the insurance , that will save us a few bucks ... __eou__ Now , all this is available to you , as far as you make payment within a 30 day grace period . That shouldn't be a problem , right ? __eou__ No ... We shouldn't have any problem with that . I know we talked about a possibility for 90 days , but we won't be needing that after your discounted price . __eou__ So , if all this is agreeable to you , I'll put it all down on paper and fax a contract to you this afternoon . If you can get a signed version of the contract we've agreed upon back to me by tomorrow morning , we can go ahead and make arrangements to ship the product on Tuesday . __eou__ Great ! __eou__
I really hope to reach an agreement with you today that is suitable and beneficial for us both . I've thought through a lot of these details , and I hope we can have a chance to discuss them and resolve any differences this afternoon . __eou__ Let's get start . What kinds of things do you have in mind ? If you let us know the requirements you have from the very beginning , we can work through each one until we can come to an agreement . __eou__ Firstly , we'd like to discuss a discounted price . If you can give us a discount of 7 % on the high volumes orders , we can pay in 60 days . __eou__ Huh ... I think 7 % is little high that might be hard to do . How about this ? We'll give you a discount of 4 % , but you can have 90 days credits . __eou__ Well , that might be acceptable , if you handle the insurance fees . __eou__ No , you have to take care of the insurance . But we are willing to pay the half transport . Can you accept that ? __eou__ We cover the insurance and half the transport fee , and only have a discount of 4 % . __eou__ But you'll have 90 days to pay your bill and I'll tell you what ... I'll also throw in the discount of 10 % on your up front deposit . __eou__ Done ... __eou__
Good afternoon Miss , would you be interested in buying more life insurance ? You know , you can never get enough . __eou__ I think my husband has some . __eou__ Are you sure he ’ s purchased enough insurance for both of you ? If something terrible happened with your husband , and he doesn ’ t have sufficient insurance , my company does have a policy that could cover you and your husband if something happened to either of you . __eou__ That ’ s true . If something happened to my husband , I might lose everything . Both of us have to work to keep our home , car , and our children ’ s education . I can ’ t afford that by myself . __eou__ Could we sit and look at the policy I mentioned and see if that ’ s something suitable for you and your husband ? __eou__ Certainly . __eou__
That was a beautiful car . It ’ s a new car , but it ’ s totaled . __eou__ Well , your insurance covers sufficient money to replace it . So you don ’ t need to worry . __eou__ I don ’ t think I could afford that kind of car again . I think I ’ ll have to choose something that is not as hard to replace . __eou__ Since you are not the one who caused the accident , your insurance cost should be the same . __eou__ What will happen if I chose a smaller car ? Would the payments be the same ? __eou__ If you got a smaller car , the cost should be a little less depending on the model , age , and size . Would you still want full coverage ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__
Excuse me may I know the name of your corporation ? __eou__ China National Textiles Import and Export Corporation __eou__ We found your samples very attractive.We ' re interested in buying your garments if your prices are reasonable __eou__ Our products are of good quality.Since the prices of textiles have gone up in the world market we've had to increase them on some items by about ten percent.If you place a large order it is possible for us to cut down the prices by five percent __eou__ Can I have a reduction of seven percent ? __eou__ It depends on how much you order __eou__ Can I use the FAS terms ? __eou__ I'd rather use the CIF terms.You ' re welcome to come to talk about it in detail with your general manager and sign a contract . __eou__
Do you think I should turn down his offer ? __eou__ Yes , it's the correct thing to do . __eou__ But we may not get another partner . __eou__ Even so , we can't do business with him.he ' s not reliable . __eou__
What happens if we make a deal and thirty to sixty days after delivery the price goes down and you didn't get the best possible price ? How do I handle that ? __eou__ Well , these things happens , I know that . You just have to stay straight with me . __eou__ Right ! So how do I do that ? What will make you happy ? __eou__ Well , I suggest you just keep me posted.That should do it.That way the burden is on me to decide when to buy , not you . __eou__ Excuse me ? __eou__ Yeah , it really is that simple.Every time there's a change in the items we do business on , you let me know . That's all you need to do . __eou__ What kind of change , just in prices ? __eou__ No , any change . I want you to keep me as informed as you are . I need to know as much as you do . If you hear about something that might happen , then tell me about it.Tell me it's rumor , what it's based on and your opinion on how likely it is . __eou__ You mean on product availability , reliability and price ? __eou__ No , everthing.Those things for sure , but also labor problems , raw materials , new subcontractors , mergers , in short , anything and everything.So I can make a fully informed decision . __eou__ So it's like you want me to be your eyes and ears into the industry . I can do that , provided the company I'm working for isn't hurt . __eou__ I think we'll get along fine . __eou__
Well , we've settled the question of price , quality and quantity . Now what about the terms of payment ? __eou__ We only accept payment by irrevocable letter of credit payable against shipping documents . __eou__ I see . Could you make an exception and accept D / A or D / P ? __eou__ I'm afraid not . We insist on a letter of credit . __eou__ To tell you the truth , a letter of credit would increase the cost of my import . When I open a letter of credit with a bank , I have to pay a deposit . That'll tie up my money and increase my cost . __eou__ Consult your bank and see if they will reduce the required deposit to a minimum . __eou__ Still , there will be bank charges in connection with the credit . It would help me greatly if you would accept D / A or D / P . You can draw on me just as if there were a letter of credit . It makes no great difference to you , but it does to me . __eou__ Well , Mrs . Wang , you must be aware that an irrevocable letter of cred it gives the exporter the additional protection of the bank er's guarantee . We always require L / C for our exports . And the other way round , we pay by L / C for our imports . __eou__ To meet you half way , what do you say if 50 % by L / C and the balance by D / P ? __eou__ I'm very sorry , Mrs . Wang . But I'm afraid I can't promise you even that . As I've said , we require payment by L / C . __eou__
Hi , Bill . It's Marsha Black at MPPD Ltd . How are you ? __eou__ Hello , Marsha , I haven't heard from you in a long time . I'm great , and you ? __eou__ Not too bad at all . Do you have a minute ? __eou__ Sure , what can I do for you ? __eou__ We're getting ready to place our Christmas orders and we need to know about how much it's going to run this year.You know , so we can have the funds put aside . __eou__ I'm really busy right now . I got a lot on my plate.So this isn't an actual bid you want but just a ballpark figure ? __eou__ Right , a ballpark figure is fine , and slant it a little high if you have to . __eou__ Well , I can give you those figures now over the phone , is that okay ? Or do you need them in writing ? __eou__ It's going to be shown to the Board so I need it in writing.Make all the prices subject to confirmation so you can't be held to them . How soon can I have it ? __eou__ Is this another rush , dear ? Did you forget and wait until the last minute again ? __eou__ Yeah , I'm afraid so . I really need your help here . __eou__ Well , just because it's you . Tomorrow , say around noon . __eou__
Mrs . Miller , you are an old friend of ours . In order to encourage future business and as a gesture of friendship , we are prepared to cut our price by 5 % . Will that satisfy you ? __eou__ That's great . Thank you for making this concession . I accept . __eou__ Now I repeat , 5,000 transistor sets , specifications as shown in our catalogue at $ 20 each C . I . F . Los Angeles . __eou__ Good . Now that the price is decided on , we can discuss the packaging . __eou__ As to packaging , we'll pack them two dozens to one carton , gross weight about 25 kilos a carton . __eou__ Carton ? __eou__ Yes , corrugated cardboard boxes . __eou__ Could you use wooden cases instead ? __eou__ Why use wooden cases ? __eou__ I'm afraid the cardboard boxes are not strong enough for ocean transportation . __eou__ Cartons are comparatively light , and there fore easy to handle . They'll not be stowed away with the heavy cargo . Besides , we'll reinforce the cartons with metal straps . __eou__ All right . Carton or no carton , the packaging must be waterproof as well as strong enough to stand shock and rough handling . __eou__ You needn't worry about that . Cartons are extensively used in our shipments to foreign countries and there have never been complaints from our clients . Now , as regards payment , we have agreed to use dollars , am I right ? __eou__ That's right . As soon as I get home , I'll see about the opening of the letter of credit . __eou__ Please open the letter of credit 15 to 30 days before the date of delivery so that we'll have enough time to make all the necessary arrangements . Another thing , the L / C should be valid until the 15th day after shipment . __eou__ No problem . That can be done . I understand you'll ship the goods before the end of May ? __eou__ Right . We'll ship the goods according to the agreed time schedule . Last , but not least , the inspection is to be carried out by Houston Commodities Inspection Bureau , which is final and binding on both parties . __eou__ Yes , we agreed to that . We have great confidence in your inspection institution . Through years of dealing with you , we've convinced of your commercial integrity . __eou__ Thank you . You can rest assured that we'll do everything possible to prevent de festive commodities from going abroad . However , if there should be any disputes , we wish to have them settled through friendly discussions . __eou__ Exactly . That's what we have done in the past . __eou__ Well , it seems we have covered everything . We'll have the contract ready in a couple of days . __eou__ Can you speed it up and let me have it today ? I'm leaving tomorrow . I've been here for almost a month now , you see . My corporation is urging me to return . I've booked the ticket for tomorrow afternoon's flight at 3 . __eou__ Let me see . If we can't get the contract ready by then , we'll send it to you by airmail for your signature . __eou__ That's fine too . __eou__
Well , Mr . Brown , we've settled everything in connection with this transaction except the question of payment in yen . Now can you explain to me how to make payment in yen ? __eou__ Many of our business friends in England , France , Switzerland , Italy and Germany are paying for our exports in Japan currency . It is quite easy to do so . __eou__ I know some of them are doing that . But this is new to me . I've never made payment in yen before . It is convenient to make payment in pound sterling , but I may have some difficulty in making payment in yen . __eou__ Many banks in Europe now carry accounts in yen . They are in a position to open letters of credit and effect payment in yen . Consult your banks and you'll see that they are ready to offer you this service . __eou__ Do you mean to say that I can open a letter of credit in yen with a bank in London or Bonn ? __eou__ Sure you can . Several of the banks in London , such as the National Westminster Bank and Barclays Bank are in a position to open letters of credit in yen . They'll do so against our sales confirmation or contract . __eou__ I see . __eou__
To get around your difficulty , Mr . Brown , I'd suggest that you reduce your order by half . You can send in an Addi trional order later . __eou__ Well , I'll consider the possibility . By the way , when do I open the L / C if I want the goods to be delivered in June ? __eou__ A month before the time you want the goods to be delivered . __eou__ Could you possibly effect shipment more promptly ? __eou__ Getting the goods ready , making out the documents and booking the shipping space - - all this takes time , you know . You cannot expect us to make delivery in less than a month . __eou__ Very well , Mrs.Wang . I'll not reduce my order . I'll take the full quantity you offer . And I'll arrange for the Letter of Credit to be opened in your favor as soon as I get home . __eou__ When will that be ? __eou__ Early next week . In the meantime , I should be very pleased if you would get everything ready . I hope that the goods can dispatched promptly after you get my Letter of Credit . __eou__ You can rest assured of that . We'll book you order and inquire for the shipping space now , so that shipment can be effected within two or three weeks of receipt of your L / C . __eou__ That'll be fine . I appreciate your cooperation . __eou__ Very good . Well , thanks to your cooperation , our discussion has been very pleasant and fruitful . I sincerely hope that the volume of trade between us will be even greater in the future . __eou__ By the way , Mrs . Wang , we have a mind to do joint participation with you on Japanese arts and crafts in our market . Would you entertain this proposal ? __eou__ Well , this is something new . A few of our friends from Europe have also suggested that we participate in joint enterprise with them dealing in some of our goods . We think there are a lot of details to go into . __eou__ If you feel our proposal is attractive , it is estimated that business to the extent of over twenty million marks can be done in this manner . __eou__ Naturally , I appreciate your efforts in pushing the sale of Japanese arts and crafts . But I'm not in a position to discuss your proposal today . I must first talk to our director , and discuss it with you some other time . __eou__ All right . Anyway , I'll be staying here for another two weeks . But I'm looking forward to having something done in this respect . __eou__ We'll talk about it next time . Now that everything is settled , let's have a cup of tea , and take our minds off business for a change . __eou__
Hi , Mr . Brown , we have visited the factories and I'm very satisfied with your factories production conditions . __eou__ Yes , they are our main export bases of tools with the advantage of having good production experience and long historical record . All their products enjoy high prestige in the world market . __eou__ That's very good . But I have little knowledge about the packing of your pliers . I just want to know the details about that . __eou__ Ok , I'll show you how the packing is like . We have a showroom on the ground floor . Let's go downstairs and have a look . __eou__ Sure . __eou__ These are the various kinds of packing for pliers . Normally , we have three types of packing __eou__ Oh , the packing looks very nice . __eou__ The skin packing is the most advanced packing for this product in the world market . It catches the eyes and can help push sales . __eou__ Good , what about the export packing ? __eou__ Well , they are packed in boxes of two dozens each , 100 boxes to a wooden case . __eou__ Is the wooden case strong enough for transportation ? You see , 100 boxes of pliers are very heavy . It's about 2,400 kilograms . __eou__ You can rest assured of that . So far , no customers have complained about our outer packing . __eou__ I'm glad to hear that . By the way , do you accept neutral packing ? __eou__ Yes , we can pack the goods according to your instructions . __eou__ Very good . Ok , Mr . Brown , I'm now totally satisfied with your packing . You can execute our first order now , and I will open the L / C immediately after I return to Taipei . __eou__ All right . We'll make the shipment as soon as your L / C is on hand . __eou__
That price of ours , by the way , is for a minimum quantity of 1,000 saddles . __eou__ Yes , I noticed that . To what extent would local assembly help sales , did you say ? __eou__ 20-30 % . But we proposed the plan from the storage and delivery viewpoint . That is to say , less warehouse space and prompt delivery . __eou__ Yes , of course . Assembly would be quite a simple matter . Cycle dealers could put them together in a very short time . __eou__ Sales have been exceptionally good during the past twelve months . __eou__ Yes , I've noticed that . Where have you been placing them ? __eou__ All in the local market . One or two suggestions that came in from the distribution might interest you . __eou__ Yes . What were they ? Anything that will help sales ? __eou__ Perhaps . General opinion is that the rear carrier should be offered as an extra . __eou__ That's to keep the price down , I suppose . I'll take it up with our overseas department and listen to what they've got to say about this . __eou__ Thanks . __eou__
I wish to make it clear at the outset that this matter of labels is entirely our problem . __eou__ I should say it is something we have never come across before . __eou__ The Federal Food and Drug Administration , or the FDA as we call it for short , imposes a whole set of regulations on the import of food products to the United States . Over the years , they have become so rigid and complicated that they are now quite a head - ache for us importers . __eou__ In my opinion , overly strict regulations are just another way of restricting imports . __eou__ Ah , there's something in what you're saying . According to the present FDA regulations , the Ma Ling Labels then cannot be used if the lichee is to be offered for import into the United States . __eou__ Why not ? Our cannedlichee and canned provisions have already been widely sold in various markets abroad , and the Ma Ling Label has now been accepted by most of overseas customers and importers . Is it quite impossible for you to use the Ma Ling labels as they are ? __eou__ I'd be quite willing to if I could , but we must comply with the label requirements according to our law , or we can't clear the consignment of lichee through the Customs . __eou__ In that case , what can we do to help you ? Have you any suggestions ? __eou__ Would you consider quoting us for the order with neutral cans on a C . I . F . basis for delivery in Hong Kong ? Our associated company there will have the labels printed to comply with the FDA regulations . __eou__ Do you think that's the only way out ? You know we usually do the labeling , as we are responsible for the brand labels of our products . __eou__
Mr . Jones , shall we now discuss the packaging ? __eou__ Very well . You know , we have definite ways of packaging garments . As to blouses , we use a polythene wrapper for each article , all ready for window display . __eou__ Good . A wrapping that catches the eye will certainly help push the sales . With competition from similar garments producers , the merchandise must not only be good value but also look attractive . __eou__ Right you are . We'll see to it that the blouses appeal to the eye as well as to the purse . __eou__ What about the outer packing ? __eou__ We'll pack them 10 dozens to one carton , gross weight around 25 kilos a carton . __eou__ Cartons ? __eou__ Yes , corrugated cardboard boxes . __eou__ Could you use wooden cases instead ? __eou__ Why use wooden cases ? __eou__ I'm afraid the cardboard boxes are not strong enough for such a heavy load . __eou__ The cartons are comparatively light , and therefore easy to handle . They won't be stowed away with the heavy cargo . The stevedores will see to that . Besides , we'll reinforce the cartons with straps . Silk blouses are not fragile goods . They can stand a lot of jolting . __eou__ Maybe you are right , but the goods are to be transhipped at Hamburg or London . If the boxes are moved about on an open wharf , the dampness or rain may get into them . This would make the blouses spotted or ruined . __eou__ No need to worry about that . The cartons lined with plastic sheets are waterproof , and as the boxes are made of cardboard , they will be handled with care . __eou__ Well , I don't want to take any chances . Besides , cartons are easy to cut open , and this increases the risk of pilferage . __eou__ Tampering with cartons is easily detected . I should say that this rather discourages pilferage . __eou__ Maybe so , but I'm afraid that in case of damage or pilferage , the insurance company will refuse compensation on the ground of improper packing , or packing unsuitable for sea voyage . __eou__ But cartons are quite seaworthy . They are extensively used in our shipments to continental ports . There are never any complaints from our clients , and our insurance company has also approved such packing for W . P . A . and T . P . N . D . __eou__ If you could guarantee compensation in case the insurance com - any refuses to honor a claim for faulty packing , we would be quite willing to accept cartons . __eou__ I'm sorry , but we can't take on any responsibility that is beyond our functions and powers . We'll make sure that the packing is seaworthy , but we can't commit ourselves to being responsible for every kind of mishap . __eou__ I can understand your position . Perhaps I'm asking too much . __eou__ We'll use wooden cases if you insist , but the charge for packing will be considerably higher , and it also slows delivery . __eou__ Well , I'll call you immediately for instructions on the matter . __eou__ Please do . I'll be waiting for your reply . __eou__
Now we have settled the terms of payment . Is it possible to effect shipment during September ? __eou__ I don't think we can . __eou__ Then when is the earliest we can expect shipment ? __eou__ By the middle of October , I think . __eou__ That's too late . You see , November is the season for this commodity in our market , and our Customs formalities are rather complicated . __eou__ I understand . __eou__ Besides , the flow through the marketing channels and the red tape involved take at least a couple of weeks . Thus , after shipment it will be four to five weeks altogether before the goods can reach our retailers . The goods must therefore be shipped before October ; otherwise we won't be in time for the selling season . __eou__ But our factories are fully committed for the third quarter . In fact , many of our clients are placing orders for delivery in the fourth quarter . __eou__ Mr . Brown , you certainly realize that the time of delivery is a matter of great importance to us . If we place our goods on the market at a time when all other importers have already sold their goods at profitable prices , we shall lose out . __eou__ I see your point . However , we have done more business this year than any of the previous years . I am very sorry to say that we cannot advance the time of delivery . __eou__ That's too bad , but I sincerely hope you will give our request your special consideration . __eou__ You may take it from me that the last thing we want to do is to disappoint an old customer like you . But the fact remains that our manufacturers have a heavy backlog on their hands . __eou__ But can't you find some way to get round your producers for an earlier delivery ? Make a special effort , please . A timely delivery means a lot to us . __eou__ All right . We'll get in touch with our producers and see what they have to say . __eou__
Well , that was an interesting documentary ! __eou__ For sure ! I didn ’ t really understand some of the technical jargon they used in the film when they talked about social security in the US . __eou__ Like what ? __eou__ Well , they mentioned how people put away money in something called a 401K ? __eou__ Yeah , I know it sounds weird , but a 401k is a type of retirement plan that allows employees to save and invest for their own retirement . Through a 401K , you can authorize your employer to deduct a certain amount of money from your paycheck and invest it in the plan . Everyone tries to contribute as much as possible so that when you retire , you can rest peacefully on your nest egg . __eou__ That ’ s interesting and logical I guess . In my country , we also have to contribute to a government-run retirement fund , but most people don ’ t really trust it so they just invest in properties or things like that . __eou__ That seems a bit unstable don ’ t you think ? __eou__ Yeah , but corrupt governments in the past have created distrust among banks and financial institutions , so now people prefer to have money hidden in a jar or a piggy bank . __eou__ I ’ Ve been thinking of doing that lately ! I don ’ t want some banker to run off with my money ! __eou__
It has just occurred to me that there is still another possibility to ensure a prompt delivery of the goods . __eou__ And that is ? __eou__ How about making Hong Kong the port of shipment instead of New York ? __eou__ I'm afraid we can't agree to that . We concluded the business with you here in Houston , and the goods you ordered are manufactured in New York . We wish to point out that all orders accepted by us are shipped from New York or Seattle . Hong Kong is out of the question . __eou__ It's like this . There are only one or two ships sailing a month from New York to Osaka , while sailings from Hong Kong are quite frequent . If shipment were effected from Hong Kong , we could receive the goods much earlier . __eou__ I see . You want to have your goods shipped from New York to Osaka via Hong Kong , where they can be transshipped . Is that the idea ? __eou__ Yes , exactly , because I want these goods on our market at the earliest possible date . __eou__ Your idea may be a good one , but the trouble is that there are risks of pilferage or damage to the goods during transshipment at Hong Kong . How about shipping them from Seattle instead of network ? You may choose either one as port of shipment . It makes no difference to us . There are more sailings from Seattle than from New York . __eou__ It sounds all right to me , but I will have to think about it . I'll give you a definite answer tomorrow . If I choose Seattle , will it be possible for you to ship the goods by the end of March ? __eou__ We'll try our best . Anyway , we assure you that shipment will be made not later than the first half of April . __eou__
Hello , Sir , may I help you ? __eou__ Yes . I would like some information for requesting a loan . __eou__ Very well , here are the general terms of our loan policies . We pride ourselves in having the lowest interest rate in the country for personal loans . __eou__ I see . So let me get this straight . If I borrow let ’ s say , ten thousand dollars , how much will I have to pay each month ? __eou__ It depends on how long you take to pay it back . If we lend you ten thousand dollars at an annual interest rate of ten percent for forty eight months , you would have to pay each month a portion of the loan which is called the principal and another small portion of the annual interest rate . This of course is considering that you don ’ t default on a payment ! __eou__ It sounds good but , there is just one problem . I have a terrible credit score . __eou__ That is a very serious problem you see , the bank must assess your personal information , past loans , assets and any other relevant information such as your credit score in order to approve your loan . __eou__ You know what ? I don ’ t really need the money . Thanks anyways ! __eou__
Good morning . I ’ d like to ask some questions about your insurance policies . __eou__ Of course . Please sit down . How can I help you ? __eou__ I bought a house recently and would like to insure it and its content . __eou__ I see . Here ’ s a pamphlet about our home insurance policy . We ’ Ve named our policy ” umbrella ” . May I ask how much you paid for your home and where you live ? These are the two main thing that decide how much your premiums are . __eou__ I understand . I live in the Oakfield area and paid $ 100,000 for my home . __eou__ Let me just check that on my computer . Oakfield is a low risk area , so your premiums will probably be around $ 100 a month . The other thing to take into account is deductibles . __eou__ In this pamphlet it says that the minimum amount for deductibles is $ 2000 . what does that mean exactly ? __eou__ It means That the first $ 2000 of any claim you make must be paid by you . The insurance policy covers any amount above that , up to the agreed limit . __eou__ Oh , I see . That ’ s fine . What is the advantage of having higher deductibles ? __eou__ If you have higher deductibles , your premium are lower , because you will pay more of the claim and we will pay less . __eou__ It seems that I should do some calculations before deciding . I presume that the insurance period can be for as long as we agree . __eou__ We initially sign one-year policies with our policyholders . These are renewable after the first year . __eou__ If I have a claim , how long does it take to make a settlement ? I ’ Ve heard that with some insurance companies , it can take months . __eou__ That is of great concern to out clients . We aim to satisfy all claims within a month , but we can ’ t guarantee that __eou__

I like to have easy access to my money . __eou__ Alright , then , with this chequing account you ’ ll be issued a debit card and a cheque book . Will you require overdraft protection ? There is an extra fee for that . __eou__ No , that won ’ t be necessary . __eou__ In that case , I ’ ll get you to fill out this paperwork .

Hello , madam . Would you like to take a look at our products ? They are high-tech items . __eou__ Hmm , they look interesting . Can I have a copy of your brochure ? __eou__ Sure .

Which service offered by your bank do you use most ? __eou__ I use several services . Of course , I deposit and withdraw money quite often . I often use my ATM card to take money out of my current account . I use my bank to exchange money from one currency to another . I often travel abroad , you see . __eou__ Do you ever ask you bank for traveller ’ s cheques ? They are much safer than carrying lots of cash around . __eou__ I sometimes use traveller ’ s cheques , but sometimes I travel to countries where they are hard to exchange for cash . __eou__ Do you use your bank to pay your utility bills ? I use direct debit . __eou__ Yes , I do . It save me a lot of time . I also have standing orders for my subscriptions to magazines . __eou__ That ’ s good idea . You don ’ t need to worry about missing an issue of a magazine if you do that . I suppose you have a mortgage too . __eou__ Yes . My bank offers very good terms and conditions on mortgage . There ’ s a lot of competition between banks nowadays . Each one is trying to offer better conditions and services than the others . __eou__ I have a deposit account with my bank . There are some restrictions on withdrawing money , but the interest rate is much higher . __eou__ I don ’ t have one . I prefer to buy shares . My bank also provides a share trading service . It ’ s cheap and easy to use . __eou__ That ’ s great . But I prefer to put my money somewhere where the returns are more certain . __eou__
Hello . Can I help you , ma'am ? __eou__ Yes . Could you tell me how to send some money to someone with an account with a bank in Germany ? __eou__ Well , you can pay by mail , telegraphic or SWIFT transfer . Or you can have a banker's draft and mail it yourself to the beneficiary . __eou__ Which is the best way ? __eou__ It depends on the amount and how fast you want that person to receive the money . A SWIFT transfer is the fastest method but a banker's draft is usually the cheapest . How much do you wanna send ? __eou__ $ 800 . __eou__ Why don't you send it by mail payment order ? __eou__ How long does it take ? __eou__ About a week . __eou__ I don't know . Can I send it more quickly ? __eou__ Sure . You can have a Telegraphic or a SWIFT transfer . __eou__ And how long do those take ? __eou__ Both a Telegraphic Transfer and a SWIFT transfer will normally be credited to the payee's account within three or four working days , depending on whether the beneficiary's bank is among our correspondent banks or we have to route the transfer through a third bank . __eou__ I see . How can I pay by Telegraphic Transfer ? __eou__ You have to fill out this form , ma'am . __eou__
How do you use an ATM card , billy ? __eou__ It's easy grandpa . Insert you card into the machine here . Then wait a moment . Ok . Now you enter your PIN . It should have four numbers . __eou__ Oh yes . I've got it written down here . Just a minute . __eou__ You really shouldn ’ t write it down . You should memorize it . You can change it to a more convenient number if you like . __eou__ Ok , I've entered my PIN . There are several options on the screen . I guess I just choose which service I want , don't I ? __eou__ Yes . Choose the service you need to use . If you choose to withdraw money , the machine will ask you how much you want . __eou__ I can just enter the amount using the keys , right ? __eou__ That's right . Give the machine a moment to process you request . Then take your money . __eou__ These machines aren't very difficult to use . In fact , I quite like them . They are much faster than dealing with a band clerk . __eou__
Hi . May I help you ? __eou__ Yes . What's the buying rate for euro ? __eou__ 1.15 U . S . dollars to the euro . __eou__ Okay . I'd like to change some euro into US dollars , please . __eou__ Sure .

Hey , son , are you insured ? __eou__ Not yet , but I'm thinking of it . Have you bought one , Dad ? __eou__ I took out a life insurance policy and made your mother the beneficiary . __eou__ Can you tell me why you want to buy it ? __eou__ I am a fireman and it is a dangerous job . I have to consider your mother's life . __eou__ Oh , I see . Do you advise me to buy one ? __eou__ You have children now . What if something , God forbid , happens to you ? __eou__ That's true . Well , how much do you think I should get ? __eou__ A $ 100 000 policy shouldn't be too expensive . Here , call my agent . He'll give you a good deal . __eou__
Good morning . How can I help you ? __eou__ I'd like to open a new account . __eou__ Have you filled out an application form ? __eou__ Yes . And I've brought some documents along with me , too . Do you need to see my passport ? __eou__ Yes . I'll just have my assistant look over these quickly and then we'll move on to the next step . Did you want to open up a checking account and a savings account ? __eou__ Yes . Does the checking account come with a debit card ? __eou__ Yes . Actually , both accounts come with cards that you can use in ATM machines , so that you won't have to come in to the bank to make a transaction . __eou__ That's very convenient . __eou__ It is . Our customers really like it . Do you have any other questions about your new accounts ? __eou__ Yes . What's the maximum amount that you are allowed to have in an overdraft ? __eou__ The maximum is $ 1000 . __eou__ Is there a penalty for having an overdraft ? __eou__ Yes , but it's not much . You just have to pay 1 % interest on the account . It's much lower rate than any of our loans and it's much better than owing money to most credit cards . __eou__ That's true .

During the last two years , there has been a great increase in goods stolen abroad . __eou__ If they steal the entire package , that would be theft . So they don't do that . Generally , thieves open the case and take part of the contents out . Then fill the case so that the gross weight will be the same . __eou__ If the goods are received in apparent good order and condition , the steamship company doesn ’ t have liability for pilferage . How do we protect ourselves ? __eou__ The insurance policy protects us . __eou__ Is it true that products of high value such as watches , jewels and luxury clothing items are often subject to pilferage ? __eou__ It's absolutely true in the United States that losses from pilferage have been limited to high valued goods . We must study more about packing . __eou__

Enjoy the rest of your day . __eou__

That way , we will handle the insurance through our broker . __eou__ Yes , we could also make this arrangement , , if you prefer . __eou__

How do you use an ATM card , Billy ? __eou__ It ’ s easy , grandpa . Insert you card into the machine here . Then wait a moment . OK . Now you enter your PIN .

I guess I just choose which service I want , don't I ? __eou__ Yes . Choose the service you need to use .

What can I do for you ? __eou__ I would like to cancel one of my accounts . __eou__ Is there a problem with your account ? __eou__ I only need one . __eou__ What about all your money in that account ? __eou__ Could you please transfer that money to my remaining account ? __eou__ That ’ s fine . __eou__ I appreciate it . __eou__ Would you like to make a withdrawal ? __eou__ That ’ s all for today . __eou__ I ’ ll just cancel your account right now . __eou__ I greatly appreciate your help . __eou__
I would like to open an account please . __eou__ Do you have any form of ID ? __eou__ I have my Tennis Club card . Is that good enough ? __eou__ I ’ m afraid not . It has to be a passport or a valid driver ’ s license . __eou__ Oh ... wait a minute ... here ’ s my driver ’ s license . __eou__ OK , just fill in this application . You can sit over there . This brochure explains our services . We have free checking , and you will be given a debit card and on ATM card . There is no service __eou__ OK , I ’ ll fill out the form and come right back . __eou__
Which services offered by your band do you use most ? __eou__ I use several services . Of course , I deposit and withdraw money quite often . I often use my ATM card to take money out of my current account . I use my bank to exchange money form once currency t __eou__ Do you ever ask you bank for traveller's cheques ? They are much safer than carrying lots of cash around . __eou__ I sometimes use traveller's cheques , but sometimes I travel to countries where they are hard to exchange for cash . __eou__ Do you use your bank to pay your utility bills ? I use direct debit . __eou__ Yes , I do . It saves me a lot of time . I also have standing orders for my subscriptions to magazines . __eou__ That ’ s good idea . You don ’ t need to worry about missing an issue of a magazine if you do that . I suppose you have a mortgage too . __eou__ Yes . My bank offers very good terms and conditions on mortgage . There ’ s a lot of competition between banks nowadays . Each one is trying to offer better conditions and services than the others . __eou__ I have a deposit account with my bank . There are some restrictions on withdrawing money , but the interest rate is much higher . __eou__ I don ’ t have one . I prefer to buy shares . My bank also provides a share trading service . It ’ s cheap and easy to use . __eou__ That ’ s great . But I prefer to put my money somewhere where the returns are more certain . __eou__
I ’ Ve just taken out an insurance policy . Are you insured ? __eou__ Yes , I am . I have life insurance and my home and its contents are also insured . __eou__ I took out a life insurance policy and made my wife the beneficiary . __eou__ That ’ a good idea . You are a fireman and it can be dangerous job . __eou__ I need to make sure that my wife will be financially secure if I die . __eou__ I can terminate my life insurance policy when I retire and use the money as a pension . __eou__ That ’ s one of the conditions of my police too . It covers you if you die before you retire and when you retire . __eou__ Did you have to take a medical before you could take out the police ? __eou__ Yes , I did . It was one of the conditions of the insurance police . The insurance companies need to assess the risk __eou__
So , Jimmy , how does it feel to have your own money ? __eou__ It ’ s great , dad . I don ’ t mind delivering papers , but the real fun is collecting the money . __eou__ Even though you are only twelve , it ’ s not too early to start saving a little money . __eou__ I ’ Ve never had a bank account before . Why don ’ t I just keep my money under the matters like grandpa does ? __eou__ You know you would spend it . And also , money in the bank earns interest . __eou__ But what if I need my money suddenly ? __eou__ The bank will give you a PIN , and you can withdraw money from any ATM . __eou__ Great ! So it ’ s almost the same as keeping it under the matters ! __eou__ Not quite . You have to maintain a minimum balance of twenty dollars . And sometimes the bank has service charges . But you don ’ t have to worry about that yet . Let ’ s go make your first depot __eou__ OK . Guess I have to do that before . I can make money my first withdrawal . __eou__
I would like to exchange Chinese money into German currency please . __eou__ Certainly . How much will you be exchanging today ? __eou__ How about 50,000 RIB . Would that be a problem ? __eou__ That ’ s a hefty amount . But that should have no problem at all . You should be aware that there is a ten-percent service charge , though . __eou__ Ten percent ! Now that ’ s hefty ! __eou__ Wait a minute ... do you have an account with us ? __eou__ Yes I do; here is my account number . __eou__ For members , there is a small transaction charge , but it ’ s only 5 dollars per transaction . Any particular denomination ? __eou__ 3,000 marks in hundreds and the rest in tens and twenty ’ s , please . __eou__ Here you are Mr . Lee . Will there be anything else ? __eou__
I would like to withdraw my money and close my account please . __eou__ May I see your passbook . __eou__ Here you are . __eou__ This is a sizable sum . Is there any reason you are closing your account with us Mr . Lee ? __eou__ I will be leaving the city soon so I have no need for this account . __eou__ I see . Well for this amount I will have to get my manager ’ s approval . __eou__ No problem . I ’ ll wait over there . __eou__ Thank you . This should only be a few minutes . If you would like , there is coffee by those sofas over there . __eou__ No , thanks . Coffee makes me wired and I will be nervous enough carrying all that cash . __eou__
Good morning , miss . __eou__ Good morning , sir . __eou__ Could you tell me please where can I find a currents exchange ? __eou__ Right here , how can i help you today , sir ? __eou__ I'd like to exchange 5000 Singapore dollars into the US dollars please . __eou__ Do you have an account this bank , sir ? __eou__ Yes , here is my account number . __eou__ May i please see ID ? __eou__ Sure , here is my passport , by the way what is the rate today ? __eou__ Today's rate is 2.57 Singapore dollars for 1 US dollar , here is your money , sir.Please count it and sign your name here . __eou__ Yes , it is the credit demand.Where can I cash travellers ' cheques ? __eou__ You can cash them here , how much do you want to cash ? __eou__ 900 dollars . __eou__ How would you like it ? __eou__ I need 8 hundreds and the rest in 10s please ? __eou__ Ok , here you are . __eou__ Thank you , have a nice day . __eou__ Thank you , have a good day . __eou__
Hey honey , how was your day ? __eou__ It was alright . I ran into Bill and we got to talking for a while.He ’ s in a bit of a jam . __eou__ Why ? What happened ? __eou__ Well , his son had an accident and Bill doesn ’ t have health insurance . This really got me thinking , and I wondered if we shouldn ’ t look into a couple of different HMO ’ s . __eou__ Yeah , you ’ re right . We aren ’ t getting any younger and our kids are getting older . __eou__ Exactly ! I searched on the web and found a couple of HMO ’ s with low co-pays and good coverage . The deductibles are low , too . __eou__ Sounds good , although , do you think we can qualify for insurance ? Those insurance companies are real pirates when it comes to money . __eou__ Well , we don ’ t have any pre-existing illnesses or conditions , so we should be fine . __eou__ I wish our company or country provided us with healthcare . __eou__ Not in a million years ! __eou__
Hey , John ! I haven ’ t seen you in ages ! What ’ s new ? What have you been up to ? __eou__ Pete ! Nice to see you Well , on top the norm , you know , wife and kids and work , I ’ Ve actually gotten into doing some trading . __eou__ Trading ? You , big guy ? What are you trading ? __eou__ Currencies . __eou__ Currencies ? As in Euros , Dollars , Pounds and Rupees ? __eou__ It ’ s called Forex . Foreign Exchange . The great thing about it is that I don ’ t have to invest a huge amount . I put in a margin deposit and then I can buy and sell up to 100 times that much ! __eou__ I don ’ t understand . You ’ re buying and selling money ? __eou__ You got it ! Just last night I made USD 150 ! __eou__ Last night ? __eou__ Yeah ! It ’ s a 24 hour market ! I had bought some RIB earlier at a low asking price but last night it appreciated drastically so I made a split second decision and sold all my RIB at an amazing bid ! I ’ __eou__ You ’ re kidding ! I ’ m on ! Where do I sign up ? __eou__
Sorry to bother you sir , but I have some bad news . __eou__ What is it ? __eou__ Well , the stock market just took a huge plunge and we ’ Ve lost a lot of money ! __eou__ What do you mean ? What happened ? __eou__ There are many factors that weigh in , but NASDAQ is down 200 points , the DOW JONES indicator also suffered ! Our portfolio is worth half of what it was worth points week ago . __eou__ How is this possible ? You are supposed to be talking to our stockbrokers and making sure that our securities and investments are safe and making a profitable return ! __eou__ I know sir ! We didn ’ t expect a bull market to become a bear market all of a sudden . On the other hand , you still have some high yield trash bonds and government bonds that will give us enough liquidity to cut our loses and reinvest in emerging markets . We could potentially make this tragedy work for us and make us think outside the box . __eou__ Do what you have to do ! One other thing , don ’ t tell the rest of the stockholders about this . If they find out , it ’ s the end of this company ! __eou__
are you ready to go to the bank ? __eou__ sure , what do you need to do there ? __eou__ there ’ s problem with my bank statement . There ’ s a mistake on it . I also need to withdraw some money form the ATM . __eou__ I have to exchange some money . __eou__ that ’ s right . You ’ re going away next week . __eou__ I also want to see if my salary has been paid into my bank account . There was a problem last week . __eou__ I have to pay my credit bill too . If I don ’ t pay it soon , the credit card company will charge me interest . __eou__ their interest rates are usually quite high . It ’ s a good idea to pay off your credit card debts before they attract interest . __eou__
Well , that was an interesting documentary ! __eou__ For sure ! I didn ’ t really understand some of the technical jargon they used in the film when they talked about social security in the US . __eou__ Like what ? __eou__ Well , they mentioned how people put away money in something called a 401K ? __eou__ Yeah , I know it sounds weird , but a 401k is a type of retirement plan that allows employees to save and invest for their own retirement . Through a you can authorize your employer to deduct a certain amount of money from your paycheck and invest it in the plan . Everyone tries to contribute as much as possible so that when you retire , you can rest peacefully on your nest egg . __eou__ That ’ s interesting and logical I guess . In my country , we also have to contribute to a government-run retirement fund , but most people don ’ t really trust it so they just invest in properties or things like that . __eou__ That seems a bit unstable don ’ t you think ? __eou__ Yeah , but corrupt governments in the past have created distrust among banks and financial institutions , so now people prefer to have money hidden in a jar or a piggy bank . __eou__ I ’ Ve been thinking of doing that lately ! I don ’ t want some banker to run off with my money ! __eou__
Good morning , welcome to Bank of the USA . How may I help you today ? __eou__ Hi , I need to transfer some money to another account . It ’ s urgent . __eou__ Okay , have you made a wire transfer at our bank before ? __eou__ No . I ’ Ve never made a transfer before . __eou__ It ’ s alright , I will take you through the procedure . Are you transferring funds to a company or an individual account ? __eou__ A company account . I need to pay a bill . __eou__ Okay , I ’ ll need the name of the company and their bank routing number as well as their bank ’ s address and phone number . __eou__ I have all the information in this folder . __eou__ Well . You ’ Ve come prepared.You have all the necessary materials so we can go ahead and make the transfer right now . It ’ s a simple transaction , and we can process it today . __eou__ Oh , that ’ s such a relief . I didn ’ t want the payment to be overdue . Thank you so much . __eou__ It ’ s my pleasure . __eou__
Hello , Sir , may I help you ? __eou__ Yes . I would like some information for requesting a loan . __eou__ Very well , here are the general terms of our loan policies . We pride ourselves in having the lowest interest rate in the country for personal loans . __eou__ I see . So let me get this straight . If I borrow let ’ s say , ten thousand dollars , how much will I have to pay each month ? __eou__ It depends on how long you take to pay it back . If we lend you ten thousand dollars at an annual interest rate of ten percent for forty eight months , you would have to pay each month a portion of the loan which is called the principal and another small portion of the annual interest rate . This of course is considering that you don ’ t default on a payment ! __eou__ It sounds good but , there is just one problem . I have a terrible credit score . __eou__ That is a very serious problem you see , the bank must assess your personal information , past loans , assets and any other relevant information such as your credit score in order to approve your loan . __eou__ You know what ? I don ’ t really need the money . Thanks anyways ! __eou__
Stupid girl , making me spend so much money , now I have to get it from the ATM ... __eou__ Hello , welcome to Universal Bank .

Just give me my money ! __eou__ Please type the amount you would like to withdraw.Thank you , you want to transfer 10000 USD to the World Wildlife Foundation . If this is correct please press 1 . __eou__ No , no ! Stupid machine , what are you doing ! No ! __eou__ Confirmed . Thank you for using our bank ! Please remove your card from the slot . Goodbye ! __eou__
I love your little Lulu dolls.How much for a batch of 6,000 ? __eou__ For a batch of 6,000 we would charge two dollars a doll . your total cost would be $ 12,000 . __eou__ That ’ s a little steep for our company.Do you offer any discounts ? __eou__ Well , we ’ d like to work with you . If you ordered a larger quantity we could drop the price a little . Can you increase your order to 15,000 ? __eou__ Hmmm.It wouldn ’ t be easy , but if the discount makes it worthwhile , we can consider it.How much of a discount would that give us ? __eou__ For order of 12,000 or more we charge only $ 1.5 a doll . your total cost would be $ 18,000 . __eou__ So , for an additional 6,000 dollars , we get twice as many dolls ? That still might be a little hard.Couldn ’ t you discount it further ? We ’ Ve been pricing other suppliers , and this discount might __eou__ We do value your business . I think I can offer a further discount – say 5 % ? __eou__ I think we can handle that . Let me confirm with my boss and touch base with you again tomorrow . __eou__
What separates your product from the competition ? __eou__ Our product features inventory tracking software , which continuously updates and tracks your inventory on a real-time basis . __eou__ Is the software user-friendly ? __eou__ Yes it is very easy to use and each system installation comes with a 3 - day employee training seminar . __eou__ Is this training part of the package or will it cost extra ? __eou__ Our quoted price includes the software system , installation , 3 day training seminar and ongoing troubleshooting.There are no hidden costs . __eou__
What are your terms of payment ? __eou__ Our terms are net 30 . __eou__ What if we purchase an increased quantity ? Can you give us better terms ? __eou__ You would have to order in excess of 10,000 units to be eligible . __eou__ We do not have the space in our warehouse to store over 5,000 units . __eou__ An option we can offer is two separate shipments.We will house the inventory until you are ready for us to ship it to you . __eou__
Is this the Law Firm of A & B ? __eou__ Yes , sir.how can I help you ? __eou__ I need to speak to an attorney regarding filing corporate govemance . __eou__ You would need to speak to Ms.Stevens . __eou__ Is she available ? __eou__ One moment , please , and I will connect your call . __eou__
I ’ m so frustrated ! __eou__ what ’ s wrong , Jim ? __eou__ I called the electronics shop to find out what time they close , and it took me twenty minutes to get what I wanted ! __eou__ Twenty minutes just to find out what their business hours are ? __eou__ yes.They have some sort of digital receptionist.So when I called in , a machine told me to push a button for the department I wanted to be transferred to . __eou__ Oh , I hate getting voicemail instead of a person.What did you do ? __eou__ I just kept pushing buttons . I was transferred to customer service , but there a machine told me to choose between technical help , warranty information , or price information . __eou__ Couldn ’ d you choose to be transferred to a real person ? __eou__ Eventually I did get to a real person . I found out the closing time , but by then the store had already closed ! __eou__
Lately I've felt that company morale is at an all-time low what can your firm do to help get my business back on track ? __eou__ You definitely made the right move by calling . Our primary business is creating , conducting and customizing fully interactive human resources workshops for companies just like yours . __eou__ It seems that my employees are having trouble working as a team . Not to mention serious lapses in service , sales and leadership skills . __eou__ Well as we know nothing comes out of a can . We have years of experience tailoring workshops to the specific needs of your company . We can hone in on your problem areas and have your employe __eou__ What a relief ! I was beginning to think it was no way to get my business rolling again . __eou__ That's what we're here for , the human resources help you need , when and how you need it . __eou__
I understand we will need seven air conditioning units on the two floors.That ' s what you think , yes ? __eou__ Yes . You could use five or six units.But five or six wouldn't be very efficient . I recommend seven . __eou__ And if we take the Decker units you suggested , what would the price be ? __eou__ Let me calculate the price for you . I can give you a 15 % discount if you buy the seven units.Let ' s see here . Your total would be 5929 dollars . __eou__ Isn't there any way we can get central air conditioning in this building ? __eou__ As I said , it is possible , but it would be much more expensive . I think it would be at least 12000 dollars to do a complete system . __eou__ That's too much . We need to use the separate units , I guess . __eou__ It's more practical , and the new units really are very quiet.Your customers won't even notice them . __eou__ So you say we can do it for 6000 dollars . __eou__ Yes , that's for the units.Installation would probably be another 700 to 1000 dollars.But it depends on the time spent , of course . __eou__ You mean installation isn't included ? I'm very surprised . __eou__ No , Ma'am . Installation isn't included.The price I quoted was just for the units . __eou__ In Taipei , you know , the company usually installs the things they sell.They don't charge extra . __eou__ I know that , Ma'am . But they would just raise the price of the units to cover their costs.Here in L . A . , installation is charged separately . __eou__ Yes , I suppose I should get used to it.But I'm not really willing to spend more than 6000 dollars for this.We haven't even opened yet . __eou__ I understand , Ma'am . __eou__ And the other company that gave me a quote on this said they could do it for 4000 dollars . __eou__ It's a question of quality , Ma'am . At that price , you would not get good equipment . I've been in this business for almost twenty years . I know what happens.If you don't get quality air conditioning now , you will just have to replace the system after two years . __eou__ I will tell you what I can agree to.If you can quote me a price of 6000 dollars , installation included , I can accept . __eou__ Well . __eou__ You do seem like a better company than the other one.So I am willing to pay more than 4000 for you . But I won't pay more than 6000 . __eou__ Well , we don't usually do it , but ... I believe we can accommodate you on this.We will do the installation for free . Because we appreciate your business . __eou__ Good . I hope we can arrange the contract as soon as possible . __eou__
I ’ d like to open a savings account . Can you tell me how to do it ? __eou__ Ok , you have to fill out the form . And I let me see three identification cards or documents . __eou__ I have the driver ’ s license , a membership card and my passport . Would we do ? __eou__ Let me see them . Yes . There ’ re ok . __eou__ What ‘ s the minimum amount I can deposit in an account ? __eou__ You can deposit and ensure amount of ten dollars . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__
You won't believe what just happened . __eou__ What ? __eou__ I went down to change some money , right ? __eou__ Yes . We need some . How much did you change ? __eou__ I wanted to change around 5000 dollars . And you know the exchange rate . __eou__ Yes , it's about 35 pesos for every Taiwan dollar , right ? __eou__ Not today . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ I went into the bank with my money , and I looked at the exchange board.At first I couldn't believe it . I thought I was reading the board wrong or something . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ Because the board said 60 pesos for every Taiwan dollar . __eou__ Sixty ? That's too much . How can that be ? __eou__ I thought it was wrong too . It didn't make sense . __eou__ Just two days ago it was 35 . How can it be 60 ? __eou__ So , I went up to the teller and started to exchange the money . And it's true.They really gave me sixty pesos for the dollar . __eou__ That's amazing ! Really ? How could it change so much in two days ? __eou__
I ’ d like to withdraw some money from my account . __eou__ Can I see your passbook and with your draft please ? __eou__ Sure ? __eou__ Let me just make sure . You want to withdraw one thousand dollars . __eou__ That ’ s right . __eou__
Welcome to the company . We are conducting a survey of new employees to find out what influenced them to choose our company . __eou__ That's easy . It was your office ergonomics that decided me . __eou__ You're kidding ! Something as simple as that ? __eou__ Yes . It is very important to me . My mother worked in offices for twenty years , and she finally had carpal tunnel syndrome . I have been reading about repetitive stress injuries , and I know that t __eou__ Yes , there has been a lot of research into RSI's . Something so simple as proper chair height can prevent injuries . Tell me , did anything else influence your decision ? __eou__ Yes , I noticed that you have professional training and team-building days . I like the idea of working for a company that invests in its staff . __eou__ Well , welcome to the team . __eou__
Have you had a chance to look over the contract ? __eou__ Yes . I've read it carefully . __eou__ And do you have any questions ? __eou__ No . But the contract stipulates that I will teach 22 hours a week.Will you have thatmany classes for me right away ? __eou__ No , probably not . For the first two weeks you may teach 10 or 15 hours . __eou__ But my salary will be 1100 dollars a month.Will you pay me that much for the first month ? Because , I mean , I won't be working so many hours . __eou__ I understand . That's why I didn't write the date on the contract.For the first two weeks , we will pay you according to the hours you teach.When you have 22 hours of classes , then the contract will take effect.Is that alright with you ? __eou__ Oh , so I don't sign the contract today . Is that right ? __eou__ I don't want you to misunderstand , Miss Briggs.We are very serious about hiring you . We want you to teach for us.We usually do contracts this way because it is more convenient . __eou__ I can accept that . __eou__ Good . And your benefits will begin immediately . __eou__ Even my health insurance ? __eou__ Yes . We will apply for your health insurance tomorrow.And your free membership in the club starts today if you like . __eou__ I have a few questions about the free membership . __eou__ What would you like to know ? __eou__ Is my membership the same as paying club members ? I mean , can I get discounts at club hotels ? __eou__ Absolutely . The only difference is in the restaurant and bar vouchers . __eou__ What are bar vouchers ? __eou__ Paying club members get around 300 dollars a year in restaurant vouchers.The vouchers can be used in the restaurant or the lounge.But we don't offer vouchers to employees . __eou__ But according to the contract , employees get a discount in the restaurant . __eou__ That's right . So in a way , it is cheaper for you than for the members.You get more benefits than they do . __eou__ So , for now , you want me to keep a copy of the contract.But we won't sign it yet . That right ? __eou__ Yes . I've prepared the contract just so that you understand everything.So that you understand the terms . __eou__ I understand.And according to the terms on the contract , I am happy to accept this job . I look forward to it . __eou__ I'm very pleased . We look forward to having you here , Miss Briggs . __eou__
I hate to be the bearer of bad news , but it's that time of year again . Have you got your performance evaluations finished yet ? __eou__ Oh no ! Evaluations ! You can tell that's not my favorite job ; I haven't even started yet . When is the deadline for turning in thecompleted forms ? __eou__ Well , you do still have three weeks . But remember the employee must sign them , too . Filling them in is nothing - it's meetingwith the employees that takes so much time . __eou__ I never know how to rate the employees ' work . Of course attendance and productivity are easy , I just look at the sales figures . __eou__ So it's the subjective criteria like team building and colleague support that you find hard ? __eou__ Exactly ! Attitude ... how do you rate attitude ? __eou__ I suggest letting each employee fill out his or her own evaluation for those items . Then , based on their self - assessment , you can add your comments . It's a great starting point for discussion __eou__ Great idea . And after all , that's the whole point of an evaluation . I almost can't wait to give it a try . __eou__
I ’ d like to have this cashed , please . __eou__ Please put your name and address here . May I see your passport . __eou__ Yes . __eou__ How would you like it ? __eou__ Ten hundreds and Ten Twenties and the rest of small changes please . __eou__ Ok , here you are . __eou__

What are you business hours ? __eou__ 10 o ’ clock in the morning to 2 o ’ clock in the afternoon . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ Not at all . __eou__
Welcome to the company . We are conducting a survey of new employees to find out what influenced them to choose our company . __eou__ Honestly , the flexible hours were the main attraction for me . The traditional working day doesn't fit in with me lifestyle ; I love being able to tailor my working hours . __eou__ Yes , flextime has definitely been a good change for us . How do you feel about the pay ? __eou__ At first it is going to be difficult . During the first three months , I'm on probation . So I won't get sales commissions until after that . __eou__ But there is a big bonus for employees at the end of the probation period . __eou__ Yes , I'm looking forward to that ! I just hope my first performance review is favorable . __eou__ One thing you can be sure of your manager will be quite fair . If your job performance is up to par , you shouldn't be afraid of a performance review , __eou__ Great ! Then I suppose I'm looking forward to my first promotion , too . __eou__
I ’ d like to apply for a personal loan . __eou__ How much would you like to borrow ? __eou__ A thousand dollars . __eou__ Let me check with a credit manager .

That's great that you found a school that puts your need first . __eou__ As well my company has been very supportive about my decision.They ' Ve cut back my working hours in order to accommodate my studies . __eou__ That's great . They must really be committed to staff development . __eou__ They are.We definitely see eye-to eye on my enhanced performance being a win-win situation for everyone involved . __eou__
Can you tell me , Ms . Smith , about the training programs you initiated this year ? __eou__ We ran a call center training service and language program to ensure that our customer service representatives are well trained . __eou__ What ’ s the result ? __eou__ We directly attribute an increase in our customer service feedback of 50 % to the increase in language skills and training that our employees have received . __eou__ That seems very impressive . Good work ! __eou__ Thank you , but I cannot take all the credit . Our employees have all worked very hard to increase their productivity level . __eou__
I ’ d like to open a current account . __eou__ Certainly . May I see your social security and your ID Please . __eou__ Here your are . I wonder how much interest can I earn for my current account . __eou__ Oh . Current account don ’ t pay our interest . __eou__ Why is that ? __eou__ It ’ s primarily design for business transactions . That is write checks to pay the bills , buying things and sending money . We won ’ t expect a large amount of deposit in current account . __eou__ I see . How do I draw money from my news then . __eou__
Well , we've finally put the finishing touches on the training programs for next year . Here's a report showing the projected costs as well as the expected return on investment . __eou__ Return on investment ? How can you have a return on this kind of investment ? Can you really calculate the value of these training programs ? __eou__ Sure ! It's not a real figure , of course . It's just an estimate based on rehiring costs , and the potential lost revenue that results from incompetence . __eou__ Wow ! I'm impressed . So , what's in the cards for future training ? Will it be in-house or off-site ? __eou__ A little of both . We'll have a few daylong sessions for things like business writing skills and software training . Those are available to everyone . We also have a variety of other programs __eou__ Yes , I see that here ... continuing education for the IT department , a time management course for accounting , and team building for sales . Anything planned for HR ? __eou__ A holiday , I hope ! No , really , we are looking into some courses on motivational techniques . We'll add them to the list when we choose a lecturer . __eou__
Mr . Smith , I have been doing some industry research and was shocked to learn that the average salary for a position that is similar to mine pays on average $ 2,000 more per year than I am c __eou__ What are you basing this information on ? __eou__ First and secondary research . I hope that you can address this concern immediately as i find it very disturbing . __eou__ Yes , I will.We are very happy with your performance and want to continue our woodworking relationship . __eou__ I wish the same . As such , I hope you will seriously consider a pay increase . __eou__ Let me take this up with the Director and get back to you immediately . __eou__
So , tell me , what makes you think we should give you a raise ? __eou__ I've got several good reasons . I've been here several years , my work has proven to be good , and I've noticed that people in comparable jobs get paid more than I do . __eou__ Salaries are confidential , how do you know how much money these " other people " make ? __eou__ Well , I've noticed all the new cars around here , for one thing . __eou__ Those are company cars provided to the sales staff for their business trips . Also , some employees receive sales commissions . So good salesmen will naturally earn more . __eou__ That's understandable . Well , rather than comparing my salary with someone else's , perhaps we could talk about my job performance . Surely you've noticed the extra hours I've put in recently ? __eou__ I see your point . However , it might be hard to get a raise approved . Profits were down last quarter , and the whole company is tightening its belt , so anything that affects the annual budget __eou__ That would be very good of you , Mr . White . __eou__
As you know I ’ Ve been thinking about moving my career in a new direction . I am hoping that you will be able to provide me with a reference to help me jump-start my future . __eou__ I realize that I ’ m not in a position to offer you the kind of promotion you deserve I'll gladly do what I can to help . __eou__ Thank you . I ’ Ve really enjoyed my time here . I've grown both personally and professionally with this company . __eou__ And , as well as being a pleasure to work with , you ’ Ve been instrumental in helping us complete many key projects . __eou__ It will be hard to say good-bye . This office has become like a second home to me . __eou__ My feelings are mixed on the issue too . By helping you I ’ m losing a valuable and trusted employee . However I think you are taking a step in the right direction . __eou__
You have done an excellent job this year and we are pleased with the results . __eou__ I am glad that you have been happy with my performance . __eou__ As a result of your performance , we are happy to offer you the position of manager . __eou__ Does this title come with an increase in salary ? __eou__ Yes , it does . __eou__ Can you give me the specifics ? __eou__ Your monthly gross salary will increase by $ 500 . __eou__ That sounds fair . __eou__
Lindsay Tipping gave me your name as a reference . We are considering hiring her as an editor for our magazine . __eou__ Lindsay , of course , I will be more than happy to recommend her to you . __eou__ How long was she employed with your company ? __eou__ She freelanced with us for 3 years . She was always consistent and punctual with her assignments and a pleasure to work with . __eou__ Freelance , hmm . How do you think she will manage in an office environment ? __eou__ She ’ s a consummate professional and a team-player . I have utmost confidence in her abilities . You can ’ t go wrong in hiring her . __eou__
The consignments of chemical instruments have just reached us . We have to lodge a claim against you for inferior quality I am afraid . __eou__ Is there anything wrong ? __eou__ We bought 1,000 sets of chemical instruments from you , but there are 40 not up to the standard . __eou__ It's hard for us to believe it . Our instruments have been the best quality for years . Have you any reliable evidence ? __eou__ Here is the survey report from a well-known public surveyor in London . You may inspect the defective instruments personally __eou__ Well . According to the contract , we are responsible for repairing or replacing those defective instruments . We ’ ll send our technicians to repair them . __eou__ Forty faulty instruments means that 4 % are not up to the standard . You should compensate us for 4 % of the total account on the contract , as well as for the inspection fee . __eou__ I am sorry about the quality problem , but I propose we compensate you for 3 % of the total value apart from the inspection fee . __eou__ All right . In that case we are still willing to do business with you . __eou__
good morning . How can I help you ? __eou__ I'd like to open a new account . __eou__ have you filled out an application form ? __eou__ yes . And I've brought some documents along with me , too . Do you need to see my passport ? __eou__ yes . I'll just have my assistant look over these quickly and then we'll move on to the next step . Did you want to open up a checking account and a savings account ? __eou__ yes . Does the checking account come with a debit card ? __eou__ yes . Actually , both accounts come with cards that you can use in ATM machines , so that you won't have to come in to the bank to make a transaction . __eou__ that's very convenient . __eou__ it is . Our customers really like it . Do you have any other questions about your new accounts ? __eou__ yes . What's the maximum amount that you are allowed to have in an overdraft ? __eou__ the maximum is $ 1000 . __eou__ is there a penalty for having an overdraft ? __eou__ yes , but it's not much . You just have to pay 1 % interest on the amount . It's much lower rate than any of our loans and it's much better than owing money to most credit cards . __eou__ that's true . Is everything alright with my documents ? __eou__ they're all in order . If you just sign your name here , you'll receive your cards and pin numbers in the mail in about three weeks . __eou__ thank you very much . __eou__ you're welcome . __eou__
May I ask you a few questions about insurance ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ Now we've given a CIF Shanghai price for some steel plates . What insurance rate do you suggest we should get ? __eou__ Well . Obviously , you won ’ t want All Risks cover . __eou__ Why not ? __eou__ Because they aren ’ t delicate goods and won ’ t likely be damaged on the voyage . FPA will be good enough . __eou__ Then am I right in understanding that FPA doesn't cover partial loss for the nature of particular average . __eou__ That's right . On the other hand , a WA policy covers you against partial loss in all cases . __eou__ Are there any other clauses in marine policies ? __eou__ Oh , lots of them . For instance , War Risks , TEND and SICC . __eou__ Well , thank you very much for all that information . Could you give me a quotation for my consignment now ? __eou__ Are you going to make an offer today ? __eou__ Yes . My customer is in urgent need of the steel plates . __eou__ Ok , I'll get this rate right away . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__
